        "description": "Aviation has a difficult but imperative role in meeting net-zero goals. By prioritizing near- and long-term efforts, airlines and OEMs can refine decarbonization solutions and optimize their results.",
        "paragraphs": [
            "has committed to achieving net-zero flying by 2050,",
            " its path to reaching that goal is complex.",
            " The industry has aligned on most of the important actions needed to decarbonizeânamely, fleet renewal, disruptive propulsion technologies, operational efficiency, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) usage, and carbon offsetting.",
            " From 2005 to 2019, the aviation industry improved fuel efficiency by approximately 39 percent,",
            " but absolute growth of emissions is larger than efficiency gains by far. Going forward, achieving decarbonization in a cost-effective way requires transparency and adaptability across a wide range of carbon mitigation measures as well as a clear focus on short-term versus long-term initiatives.",
            "Many companies across the aviation value chain have set goals to be completed over the long term, but there are actions they can take today to move closer to accomplishing these objectives. To get started, companies should understand which actions to prioritize for the greatest impact and for a cost-optimal path to net-zero emissions.",
            "Prepandemic CO",
            " emissions from aviation contributed to roughly 2.5 percent of global total emissions,",
            " but the global-warming potential could be significantly greater (see sidebar âAviation and non-CO",
            " emissionsâ). The sector is hard to abate because of unique requirements, including weight and size constraints, long innovation cycles, prioritization of safe operations, and because key technologies, such as SAFs, are relatively costly and have not been adopted at scale.",
            "In addition to the CO",
            " emissions produced from burning fuel, aviation affects the climate through emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO",
            "), soot, and water vapor, which, among other effects, create contrails and cirrus clouds that cause radiation and affect the climate. The CO",
            " emitted from kerosene burned in flight can stay in the upper atmosphere for 50 to 100 years, and NO",
            " remain for several weeks, affecting the ozone layer.",
            " As such, the total aviation effects may be approximately two to four times higher than the pure CO",
            " effects would indicate.",
            "The science on non-CO",
            " effects is nascent, so most airlines (and the latest Science Based Target initiative guidance) refer only to pure CO",
            " emissions.",
            "Many stakeholders in the aviation value chain have committed to various sustainability goals, including emission-reduction targets,",
            " SAF targets,",
            " targets that include compensation,",
            " and membership in coalitions.",
            " In addition to the defined paths to reduce emissions that are in line with the Paris Agreement, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has emerged as one of the leading standards (see sidebar âThe Science Based Targets initiativeâ).",
            "The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a collaboration among four nongovernmental organizations: Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF). The initiative aims to ensure emission-reduction targets set by companies are within the pace recommended by scientists to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It also provides guidance and promotes best practices to reduce corporate greenhouse-gas emissions. As of April 2023, more than 4,500 companies have committed to or set science-based targets.",
            "Recently, the SBTi has provided guidance for an interim aviation 1.5Â° pathway, implying strict emission-reduction targets for airlines: namely, a more than 30 percent CO",
            " reduction per revenue ton kilometer (RTK) by 2030 compared to 2019 base year levels and a more than 50 percent reduction by 2035.",
            " ",
            " In comparison, the International Energy Agency Net Zero Emissions pathway calls for approximately 38 percent emission reduction in 2030 and approximately 57 percent in 2035 compared to 2019 levels. Note that both pathways set targets for relative emissions only (measured per RTK).",
            "As of April 2023, 25 airlinesâmostly based in the Americas and Europeâhave committed to setting or have set science-based targets. According to McKinsey analysis, this group represents more than 30 percent of global passenger traffic. On the OEM side, aerospace and defense companies, representing about 20 percent of the global value pool, have also committed to goals aligned with SBTi (Exhibit 1).",
            "While the ambitions are clear, actors in the aviation sector are highly dependent on each other to achieve their decarbonization commitments. For example, more than 95 percent of aircraft OEMsâ emissions come from their Scope 3 Category 11 downstream emissions,",
            " ",
            " which is mostly airlinesâ fuel burn. This interdependency has strengthened the industryâs unified ambition to decarbonize, but it also highlights the role that actors such as commercial aviation lessors, OEMs, and suppliers need to play to support airlines and offer solutions.",
            "Options for airlines to abate CO",
            " emissions differ based on existing fleet efficiency, the network of the airline, and the baseline decarbonization efforts already implemented by the airline.",
            "From a technology perspective, the development to scale new SAF pathways with improved emission-reduction potential, such as advanced biofuels or power to liquid (PtL) fuels, is uncertain.",
            " Biobased pathways face challenges in feedstock availability and collection to be immediately scalable, and PtL requires significant access to large amounts of renewable electricity. Other uncertainties remain about the progress in other technologies fields, such as new propulsion technology or advanced analytics for flight planning.",
            "From a regulatory perspective, aviation players will need to adapt to the ever-changing implementation of regional incentives and penalties. For example, Europeâs reaction to the Inflation Reduction Act could change SAF-related decarbonization costs for European airlines.",
            "Other industries such as marine and road transport, which are sourcing from the same sustainable fuel feedstock, also influence the aviation sector. This competition affects the balance of SAF supply and demand and therefore its market price, especially as the regulatory schemes and customer willingness to pay evolve.",
            "Many decarbonization efforts also require investments with longer lead times that are not in line with traditional airline yearly business planning cycles and, as such, require a different view on economic and environmental returns. Although many airlines have shown strong financial results in 2022, outlooks are uncertain as the industry returns to pre-COVID-19 capacity levels, which drives traditional airlines to limit riskier investments despite their potential payoff beyond five-year financial plans.",
            "These external factors have contributed to the struggle of companies across the aviation ecosystem to deploy multiple decarbonization efforts in the most cost-effective way, while managing uncertainties in parallel.",
            "As the timeline to hit near-term emission targets shortens, aviation sector players are increasingly searching for ways to achieve these goalsâand do so quickly to compensate for the long lead times of many initiatives. For example, solidifying sufficient access to affordable SAF can take several years, and renewing fleet quickly depends on OEMsâ or lessorsâ ability to deliver or provide new aircraft.",
            "Initiatives are organized left to right on the marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) based on the economic cost of the initiativeâs emissions abatement. Leveraging the MACC, airlines can execute decarbonization initiatives by implementing cost-negative initiatives first, such as those that save fuel.",
            "As a first step, airlines can evaluate carbon abatement costs and impact potential by developing their own marginal abatement cost curve (MACC).",
            " This assessment helps companies compare and sequence different decarbonization measures while also allowing for adjustments and updates. It also helps companies determine the best and most cost-effective decarbonization solutions for the industry (see sidebar âReading a marginal abatement cost curveâ).",
            "Exhibit 2 illustrates a typical MACC for an airline. Actions are classified by three categories: operational measures (including air traffic management), fleet renewal, and SAF.",
            " Operational and efficiency measures often come at negative or low costs (due to associated fuel savings) but are limited in their impact.",
            "Airlines can relatively easily enforce initiatives within their own control, such as introducing pilot incentive programs to fly and taxi more fuel efficiently or imposing stricter operational weight limits to reduce fuel needs. Bolder moves could affect customer experiences, such as reducing ultra-long-haul flights, removing some catering on short-haul flights, or densifying cabins to include more seats.",
            "Other efficiency efforts are dependent on collaboration among several stakeholders, especially to optimize air space usage. For example, the Single European Sky program",
            " aims to modernize air traffic control infrastructure to reduce up to 10 percent of emissions,",
            " and a similar program called NextGen",
            " is underway in the United States. However, an airlineâs actual carbon emission savings depend on its exposure to the affected airspace, and emission reductions could be significantly lower than 10 percent.",
            " Accelerated fleet rollover can come at negative marginal abatement cost, particularly when including the impact of regulatory action, such as future SAF mandates and kerosene taxes. Depending on the state of an airlineâs fleet, the evolutionary rollover to already available aircraft types represents a decarbonization potential of up to 15 to 20 percent.",
            " It is expected that next-generation aircraft, such as the Airbus A320neo or the Boeing 777-X family, will replace a significant share of current-generation aircraft in the next ten years (Exhibit 3).",
            "In the long term, both OEMs and airlines could benefit from transitioning to more fuel-efficient aircraft and could adjust their prices to reflect greater fuel efficiency.",
            " SAF is by far the most impactful initiative, but financial effects vary due to mandates, subsidies, sourcing approaches, voluntary commitments, and customersâ willingness to pay. Minimum sustainable fuelâblending mandates have been introduced in some geographies, and several airlines have committed to SAF volumes of 10 to 30 percent of total jet fuel used by 2030, totaling about 5 percent of expected aviation fuel demand in 2030.",
            "Notably, many airlines have expressed concerns around the cost, production, and timing of new SAF technologies and raised questions regarding where responsibility for spearheading and paying for these efforts lies.",
            " ",
            " Producers will need to scale different SAF-production technologies beyond those currently used because todayâs feedstocks, such as waste oils, are limited in availability. These new technologies, which are often still in developmental phases, and the costs of crucial input parameters, such as renewable electricity and green hydrogen, will affect costs to produce SAF.",
            " It is important to recognize the full impact of regulations, such as SAF mandates and carbon taxes. Because an MACC displays only the marginal cost to the airline, a government-mandated increase in SAF at European airports, for example, will show an abatement impact in the curve but limited additional marginal costs to the airline. Still, it should be recognized that mandated SAF quotas could affect airlinesâ competitiveness compared to carriers operating through hubs outside of the mandateâs geography. Carbon taxes such as the EU Emissions Trading System have an amplifying effect on the identified actions: as taxes increase, it becomes more costly to operate in a traditional way and emission-reduction strategies become less costly.",
            " One challenge in developing an MACC lies in quantifying both the impact and estimating the associated cost of initiatives. MACCs are also not static; they look different every year. While the potential mitigation options for the aviation sector are relatively well known, the abatement opportunity and effective costs to airlines are typically not well quantified and are largely affected by many uncertainties in the market.",
            " Cargo, corporate, and leisure customers have signaled or have the propensity to pay for decarbonization measures. A 2023 McKinsey survey",
            " indicated that 85 percent of travelers globally said they were willing to pay 2 percent or more for carbon-neutral flight tickets, which is a significant increase compared to previous years: in 2019 and 2021, a McKinsey survey showed consumersâ willingness to pay more for carbon-neutral flight tickets was 46 and 39 percent, respectively. But consumersâ actual behavior may differ. Another survey indicated that only 14 percent of travelers actually pay more for sustainable options when they travel.",
            " Not only are consumer decisions subject to economic factors, but there is also a scarcity of sustainable booking options and unclear sustainability-related information. As such, raising ticket prices to factor in sustainable options could reduce demand or lead consumers to shift to other connections. Still, leading carriers could limit losing customers by creating transparency, debundling products, and driving personalized, sustainable offerings based on clear segmentation.",
            "In addition to considering CO",
            " abatement and the cost of certain actions, airlines can include additional sources and criteria in their decision making. For example, taking weight-reducing measures in the cabin to reduce CO",
            " could have ramifications for an airlineâs competitiveness and its customersâ experience.",
            "MACCs will take different shapes for different stakeholders, and most initiatives will require actors to work together. Aviation OEM MACCs will likely predominantly focus on Scope 3 Category 11 emissions (use of sold products). OEMs are also dependent on airlines taking measures to improve operational efficiency to fulfil their own downstream decarbonization potential. As such, OEMs can work with airlines to aggregate demand for SAF, for instance, to reduce fuel burn in the short term.",
            "More revolutionary technologies, such as hydrogen and electric propulsion, will likely be limited to short-haul or few-passenger use cases until 2035, and the path to scaling these technologies remains uncertain.",
            "A dynamic and flexible approach to decarbonization allows stakeholders to consider changes in the market and draw implications from external ambiguity. Once companies have established targets and determined their priorities, they can take steps to make these goals more accessible. They can first recognize inherent uncertainties with regulatory landscapes, customer behavior, technology development, SAF availability and prices, and emissions. Then they can create scenarios and identify no-regret moves in the next one to three years.",
            "To ensure rigorous implementation across the different departmentsâwhich is especially relevant for weight-saving measures, in which many operational departments play a roleâairlines can benefit from a central governance structure to track and trace progress and steer where needed. Leading airlines integrate this as much as possible into their regular business planning cycles.",
            "Some themes, however, may require a temporary thematic governance structure. One example is the optimization of SAF procurement, managing short-term and long-term offtake agreements, and long-term coinvestments. Another one is taking equity stakes to invest in advanced air mobility start-ups that will help them accomplish mid-term and long-term goals.",
            "Aviation companies that integrate decarbonization efforts into their standing business planning cycles can de-risk their sustainable transition and achieve optimized decarbonization costs. While decarbonizing the aviation industry is one of the largest challenges the industry has ever faced, the significant lead times of some investments heighten the urgency for companies across the aviation value chain to act quickly to position themselves better in the future. Airlines that embrace radical transparency on their decarbonization options and investigate partnerships with other aviation value-chain actors can determine the future of green aviation.",

        "paragraphs": [
            "is intense across industries, and aerospace and defense (A&D) is no exception. The best employees, including skilled tradespeople and those with software development and engineering skills, are in high demand globally and know their value. In this environment, A&D companies around the world, despite their strong reputations, may find themselves at a disadvantage when attempting to recruit the best talent; they must compete with big tech companies and start-ups that have created strong value propositions that emphasize the importance of innovation and the creation of leading-edge technologies that change the world. Adding to the burden, A&D companies are dealing with the talent challenge at a time when the sector is growing rapidly, digitalizing many processes, and navigating other pressing challenges, including supply chain disruptions.",
            "While ",
            ", Europe faces its own share of pressing workforce issues that represent a significant call to action. The latest European Commission reporting found that 75 percent of companies report difficulties in finding workers with the necessary skills, and 40 percent of adults lack basic digital skillsâall of which has been the impetus for the Commission to kick-start the âEuropean Year of Skills.â",
            " In response, partly because of the war in Ukraine, a shift in the perception of the European A&D industry and its purpose (specifically the defense side of the sector) has taken place, including at the unexpected intersections of defense and start-ups and tech. For younger talent, for whom purpose matters significantly, this presents an opportunity.",
            "Globally, the A&D sector faces multiple challenges as it attempts to attract younger or âgreenâ employees to companies in which the workplace often skews âgrayâ and in which many of the most valued staff members are approaching their retirement years. ",
            ",",
            " in Europe, itâs closer to about one-fifth of the industry. A significant proportion of the A&D workforce is aged 50 to 54, howeverâapproaching the retirement window. This trend is present among both highly skilled manufacturing trades and advanced technical engineering professions. In the context of broader labor challenges across Europe, this presents a significant risk to the ability to deliver on future, growing industry demand (Exhibit 1).",
            "In another major postpandemic shift, workers are now more open to pursuing new opportunities, even if it means moving to a different employer. In Europe, as many as one-third of employees are thinking about changing jobs in the next three to six months.",
            " This number is lower compared to the United States, where 46 percent of employees are thinking about changing jobs in this time frame; however, this statistic is still notable in a region with a traditionally less dynamic job market.",
            " Younger workers with less job experience are the most likely to make a shift, with research showing they are twice as likely to change employers compared to long-tenured employees.",
            "The demographic shifts, as well as the new attitudes about switching jobs, have decreased talent replacement rates at A&D companies.",
            " If companies cannot replace long-tenured employees who retire, and if the turnover rate for young employees is high, A&D companies may find that their workforce lacks some of the most essential skills. In Europe, the situation is even more acute, with employers struggling to keep pace with their American counterparts on this front. This is evidenced by a lower hiring rate and higher attrition rate, especially in areas critical to the future of the industry, such as digital and advanced-analytics profiles.",
            " This trend in Europe will likely continue to worsen: as shown in ",
            ", womenâs graduation rate in higher education from STEM disciplines is declining. At current rates, the share of women in tech roles in Europe is set to decline to 21 percent by 2027.",
            " For A&D players in Europe, this is a sobering reality that will require extraordinary measures to change.",
            "Younger workersâthe âgreenâ contingentâtend to have a different conception of the employeeâemployer relationship than do older employees in the âgrayâ group.",
            " Younger workers grew up in a world where the internet made goods and services readily availableâoften instantly or with same-day deliveryâand allowed them to conduct much of their social lives online. Not surprisingly, these experiences have shaped what many younger employees now expect in the workplace, and our global research shows that six factors are particularly important to them:",
            "In this environment, the employee value proposition (EVP) that A&D employers offer has never mattered more. On a global level, the industry lags its highly competitive tech and auto peers on many of the touchstone perceptions of the EVP, including pay and differentiated benefits.",
            " That said, when it comes to the A&D industry, Europe leads the United States on most elements of the EVP, especially as it relates to perceptions of senior leadership, corporate culture, and workâlife balance. This is evidenced at a macro level by data from employee sentiment analyses, as well as at a more granular level by a ",
            " (in which two A&D players are in the top ten",
            ") or by Universumâs yearly pulse survey of French engineers, which highlights that six out of the top 15 most attractive players are in A&D.",
            " However, beyond what employers offer their employees, Europeans are less in tune with the values, mission, and collective purpose of the aerospace industry than their American colleagues (Exhibit 2).",
            "Despite geographic variation, the global trend is clear: the prize is high for creating a healthy organization with a strong EVP. For industrial manufacturing companies, including those in A&D, those who get it right are perceived by employees as making faster decisions and having strong leaders, tighter control, and better innovation. Additionally, such companies are better able to hire critical, highly competitive technical talent (Exhibit 3).",
            "A&D companies that fail to understand the needs of younger employees will find it difficult to recruit them in this competitive market. This is especially true in Europe, where the EVP of the A&D employer is stronger than the tie to the actual industry.",
            " With demand for workers becoming even more intense, a lack of talent will increasingly limit an A&D companyâs growth and performance.",
            "Navigating the gray-to-green transition will require entirely new processes and mindsets. For instance, A&D companies must go on offensive when attempting to recruit the best employees, rather than relying on their traditional channels or hoping that their reputation alone will be a draw. Human resources leaders may want to create new knowledge management solutions and retention strategies. As A&D companies rethink their talent approaches, they may benefit from focusing on three key dimensions (Exhibit 4):",
            "Leading A&D companies understand how critical these changes are and how they are essential to driving future value creation. They also understand the degree of change management that is required to shift an industry that has long benefited from a stable approach to talent management. Those that are making moves are doing so quickly and boldly.",
            "While all A&D companies are struggling to navigate the ongoing gray-to-green transition, European players face the most intense challenges. If they do not adopt a new approach to talent recruitment and retention, they may find that their workforce has multiple capability gaps that hinder both productivity and performance. But it is within their power to reverse the situation if HR and top executives across the C-suite are willing to go on the offense and create new strategies for recruiting younger employees, all backed by sufficient investment and resources. A&D companies can potentially enhance such efforts by working with educational institutions and members of the public sector to develop training programs that provide their students with critical skills. Itâs a winning proposition for all involvedâincluding the young employees who will find challenging and rewarding work in the vitally important A&D sector.",

That may not be true for much longer, however. Advances in aerospace technology, new attitudes about travel, and a growing ecosystem of established players and startups could drive a resurgence in regional air mobility.",

            "Â representing views from McKinseyâs Aerospace and Defense practice.",
            "In 2019, air travel accounted for just 4 percent of all journeys between 150 and 800 kilometers in the European Union and 8 percent in the United States, with most of these flights involving large commercial aircraft (Exhibit 1).",
            " The business of operating smaller regional aircraft is challenging; this market has substantially declined in recent years despite strong demand for air travel overall. Since 2004, flights on aircraft with six to 50 seats declined from 16 percent of available seat kilometers (ASK) on regional routes to just 4 percent in 2019.",
            " This decline has led to small airports losing service, hurting access to rural communities.",
            "These numbers may soon change, however, because of four converging megatrends that might spur demand for regional flights and make the economics more attractiveâsignificant technology advances, a greater focus on sustainability, growing frustration with road and airport congestion, and the emergence of mobility-as-a-service. These trends could fuel a new aviation paradigm, termed regional air mobility (RAM), which could lead to a resurgence in short-range flight.",
            "RAM brings together new aviation technologies and existing small airport infrastructure into a transportation model that is more equitable, more economical, and more environmentally friendly for air travel over short distances, compared to todayâs status quo. If these changes materialize, the total addressable market (TAM) for small regional flights globally could be $75 billion to $115 billion by 2035, representing 300 to 700 million passengers annually.",
            "The emergence of the RAM market is not a foregone conclusion. It will require several critical enablers: a seamless customer experience, more mature aircraft technology, public acceptance, and new energy infrastructure at small airports, as well as a substantial increase in the regional fleet size.",
            "We define RAM as the transportation of passengers and goods by air over about 150 to 800 kilometers on five- to 50-passenger aircraft (or the equivalent size for cargo), primarily using smaller regional airports.",
            "RAM is enabled by a broad range of modern technologies, such as green propulsion, digitization, and autonomy, which will reduce costs, boost reliability, and improve customer experience. This article focuses on the passenger market, although regional cargo flights also offer interesting opportunities. RAM is adjacent to the more widely discussed urban air mobility (UAM), but is different in a few important ways. UAM is focused on shorter, intra-urban distances below 150 km and involves primarily electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. RAM will primarily use runways, generally at smaller regional airports. It typically will not require new landing sites in or near dense urban cores, while UAM will. Similar to UAM, many RAM aircraft will require electric charging infrastructure. However, RAM will likely also include hydrogen-fueled aircraft, as well as hybrid aircraft, some of which can leverage existing ground infrastructure. Taken together, these factors could enable RAM to gain traction sooner than UAM.",
            "The RAM market is already taking shape. More than 50 companies are developing battery-electric, hybrid, and hydrogen powertrains; new and retrofitted aircraft designs; advanced avionics; operations and booking platforms; and other important enablers of the RAM ecosystem. More than $1 billion has been invested in these RAM start-ups to date and the first retrofitted aircraft are slated to enter service in the mid-2020s. Simultaneously, an ecosystem of operators, consisting mainly of established airlines and regionally focused start-ups, is coming together to drive the industry forward.",
            "The potential growth of RAM represents a departure from historical declines in the market for regional flights on small aircraft. Although air travel for trips between 150 and 800 kilometers has increased in recent years, with ASKs rising by 55 percent from 2004 to 2019, much of this growth was driven by low-cost carriers using larger aircraft. For aircraft with six to 50 seats, ASKs declined by almost 60 percent in the same timeframe.",
            " In 2019, passenger revenues for air trips between 150 and 800 kilometers were almost $50 billion, but only 11 percent (or $5 billion) came from flights on aircraft with six to 50 seats, including non-scheduled flights and business jets.",
            " Airlines have gradually shifted toward bigger aircraft and have consolidated operations at larger airports. A shortage of pilots has also contributed to the phaseout of small regional aircraft from airline operations.",
            "In tandem with the decline in regional traffic, production of small aircraft has slowed, with the exception of private aircraft. Deliveries of passenger aircraft with six to 50 seats (for commercial, non-scheduled, and business or private use) peaked at about 1,500 in 2008. While the global fleet of six- to 50-seat passenger aircraft grew from 21,500 aircraft in 1990 to 41,400 in 2022, the growth was exclusively driven by business or private aircraft. Excluding business or private aircraft, the fleet has declined from 6,100 aircraft in 2008 to 4,100 today. New deliveries averaged 1,000 aircraft per year from 2016 through 2022, of which 98 percent were business or private aircraft.",
            " The decline in production, combined with the increasing age of the small regional fleet, may compel regional operators to invest in green propulsion aircraft rather than extending the life of existing aircraft.",
            "Policy and local community factors have also negatively affected legacy regional air travel. In Europe, the number of Public Service Obligation routes declined from 290 in 2013 to 176 today.",
            " Similarly, US government Essential Air Service subsidies cover 175 airports today, down from 400 in 1980.",
            " In addition, concerns about noise and emissions have stymied some attempts to increase flights at regional airports.",
            " Quieter, more environmentally and community friendly RAM aircraft could begin to reverse these headwinds.",
            "Although the regional market has declined, key infrastructure remains. There are thousands of regional airports worldwide, most of them underutilized. In Europe, 50 percent of people live within a 30-minute drive of a regional airport, compared with 40 percent for a commercial airport. In the United States, 90 percent of people live within a 30-minute drive of a regional airport, compared with 60 percent for a commercial airport.",
            " This existing capacity of underutilized airports could support a growing RAM market with less investment and ramp-up time than other new modes of transport.",
            "While the regional air travel market has been in decline over the last 30 years, it could be taking off again, thanks to four global megatrends:",
            "Spurred on by these four megatrends, investment in RAM is rising. Since 2015, over $1.1 billion in investment has been disclosed for this space, out of the over ",

Other players are working on new aircraft designs using those technologies, including Airbus, Electra.aero, Embraer, Eviation, and Heart Aerospace. Yet another set is working on highly augmented flight controls and autonomy, including Boeing, Merlin Labs, Reliable Robotics, Sikorsky, Thales, and Xwing. Operators that are actively engaged in this market include Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Surf Air Mobility, United Airlines, and WiderÃ¸e Zero. There are more than 4,700 RAM aircraft or powertrains on order, option, or subject to letters of intent, with a total value of $38 billion.",
            "While the RAM market has momentum, estimates of its potential value vary widely. Our modeling suggests a TAM for RAM passenger revenue of $75 billion to $115 billion by 2035 (Exhibit 2).",
            " This includes $40 billion to $65 billion from travelers switching away from ground or marine travel, $18 billion to $20 billion from passengers who take RAM flights instead of commercial flights on larger aircraft, and $12 billion to $25 billion from stimulated demandâthat is, travelers taking trips they would not otherwise have taken, due to the convenience and availability of RAM. Our estimate of TAM includes roughly $5 billion in revenue for existing point-to-point flights 150 to 800 kilometers in length, operated by aircraft with five to 50 seats.",
            "To estimate the TAM, we used anonymized cell phone location data, which show where people travel, in combination with estimates on aircraft operating costs, operational metrics, and route-level time savings calculations. Our model assumes that demand for travel will increase in line with historical growth and that travelers will switch to RAM from ground or marine travel, or from commercial air travel on larger aircraft, if the economics and time savings merit it.",
            "Our model estimated global RAM market size and aircraft needs under two scenarios. The low-end scenario is based on a modest operating cost reduction against current small aircraft economics, while the high-end scenario reflects a more significant operating cost reduction, driven by semi-autonomous operations. Both TAM scenarios are unconstrainedâin other words, they assume that everything that is needed to enable the market will âgo rightâ and that the industry can meet demand by producing the required aircraft and establishing needed airport infrastructure, which will not be a trivial task. As a point of comparison, the estimated 2035 TAM for RAM is 8 to 13 percent the size of the 2019 global commercial airline market.",
            "For the RAM market to reach its full potential, we expect 18,000 new or retrofitted RAM aircraft will be required by 2035 in the low-end scenario and 36,000 in the high-end scenario.",
            " Achieving this level of production will require significant investment in OEM and supply chain capacity. More than 3,500 new or retrofitted RAM aircraft will need to be produced annually between 2025 and 2035 in the high-end scenario. This number is more than twice the approximately 1,500 regional or private aircraft built in 2008, the previous production peak.",
            "Many factors will influence the growth and ultimate size of the RAM market (Exhibit 3). Take trip distanceâa passenger would see more time savings compared to driving for a flight that is 800 kilometers, rather than a 150-kilometer flight. Likewise, the population density of a given geographic area must be high enough to ensure a steady stream of passengers. Choices on aircraft capacity and scheduling also play a role, as do environmental constraints, the flexibility of RAM in meeting passengersâ needs, and public acceptance. All of these categories depend on multiple variables. Public acceptance, for instance, will partly depend on guaranteeing RAMâs safety.",
            "At a macro level, four enablers will be particularly important for the RAM marketâs growth:",
            "Overall, the trends suggest that RAMâs time has come. The world may soon discover this revived form of air travel, which is more sustainable and capitalizes on underutilized infrastructure that we already have today. Re-energizing short-haul air travel will help increase equity for rural communities and stimulate economies beyond major metropolitan hubs. Material uncertainties remain about RAMâs future, but a discernible path forward exists to support strategic decision makingâand to create value in a market whose time has come.",

        "paragraphs": [

            "Â from remote sensing to communications to navigation. Governments are also expanding their satellite fleets for multiple missions. In the future, greater space exploration, the launch of commercial space stations, and even tourism could further increase launch needs. New companies are constantly entering the market and much uncertainty persists about their ambitions, as well as those of more established players. Forecasts for the number of constellations, and therefore required launch capabilities, thus vary widely.",
            "In tandem with this rise in activity, the space industry is transitioning to a new generation of launch vehicles, leading to a range of possibilities in terms of availability and capacity. In light of these dynamics, both customers (commercial and government satellite owners) and suppliers must make tricky calculations to balance short-term opportunities against the imperative to control costs and flex to longer-term demand.",
            "While government (military and civil) space activity remains a significant and growing source of launch demand, the private sector is the fastest-growing segment, amid technological advances and declining costs that have spurred innovation and commercial activity. The price of heavy launches to low-Earth orbit (LEO) has fallen from $65,000 per kilogram to $1,500 per kilogramâmore than a 95 percent decrease.",
            " In part due to these efficiencies, companies and governments are putting thousands of new satellites into orbit.",
            " Elon Muskâs SpaceX is leading the way, with its Starlink program planning to launch as many as 42,000 satellites to provide global broadband and other services.",
            "Satellite use cases span a range of applications. As of March 2023, there were 5,000 satellites serving communications, with the number of communications launches having grown by about 15 percent a year since 2017. There are about 1,000 active satellites for Earth observation and 1,500 for technology development, research, and other missions.",
            " Looking ahead, there are plans for a significant expansion to as many as 65,000 new communication satellites and 3,000 non-communication satellites (for applications such as Earth observation).",
            " In total, companies have proposed more than 100 new constellations. Direct-to-device concepts, which link satellites to cell phones, have also gained traction lately and could lead additional new entrants. Even if not fully deployed, the new constellations will drive demand for services including intersatellite links, ground terminals, analytical support and, potentially, in-orbit maneuvering and debris removal.",
            "A key driver of satellite proliferation is lower overall costs, enabled, for example, by more capabilities in small satellites such as cubesats, built from ten-by-ten-by-ten centimeter modules, and microsats, weighing less than 100 kilograms. These are used for applications such as Earth observation and in-orbit demonstrations of miniaturized technologies. Still, useful constellations (commercially or for government purposes) will require dozens to thousands of spacecraft. Moreover, as designs mature, satellites will tend to get bigger, suggesting medium and heavy launch capabilities will remain the most cost effective choice for deployment. And the new generation of satellites will operate for just five to seven yearsâallowing for technology refresh and reduced manufacturing costs. These factors are set to drive demand for significant launch tonnage.",
            "For the three scenarios, we made the following assumptions about launch demand:",
            "For launch supply, the high-supply scenario assumes that Starship will achieve a daily launch rate by 2030 and have a fleet of 30 boosters and 60 ships. Launches of Falcon 9 will taper off, except for existing contracts, and be replaced with Starship launches. The high-supply scenario also assumes that other vehicles will achieve their anticipated rate capabilities within four to six years.",
            "In the alternative supply scenario, Starship is not included in the calculation. This scenario also assumes that Falcon 9 will reach and maintain a rate of 120 launches annually, while other vehicles reach expected rate capabilities within six years.",
            "According to the not-for-profit Space Foundation, the space economy is growing strongly, up 9 percent from 2020 to reach a value of $469 billion in 2021.",
            " This was the highest recorded growth since 2014. To gauge the industryâs potential growth up to 2030, McKinsey modelled three scenarios, predicated on assumptions around the quantity, size, and timing of deployments (Exhibit 1).",
            " For each constellation, we estimated the total number of licensed or proposed satellites, expected mass, and likelihood of full deployment, which we then combined with views on launch dates and satellite lifespan. We also considered plans for non-constellation launches, such as commercial space stations, when creating the scenarios (see sidebar âAssumptions underlying the scenariosâ).",
            "Our scenarios depict situations of high demand, base-case demand, and low demand. In the base case, we anticipate 27,000 active satellites in orbit by the end of 2030, almost a four-fold increase from today. To maintain that number at the assumed lifespan, there would need to be 4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched per year.",
            "The number of planned satellites that make it to launch is a critical metric because it has implications for the thousands of companies that serve the space economy. In a high-demand scenario, in which nearly all proposed constellations materialize, we would expect to see more than 65,000 satellites, including many heavier ones, on orbit by 2030. Annual launch capability would need to be around 15 kilotons (15 million kilograms). By contrast, the base-case scenario, in which less than half of planned satellites materialize and sizes moderate, would require 4.5 kilotons of launch capacity. At the low end, characterized by fewer, smaller satellites, less than 2 kilotons of launch capacity would be required (Exhibit 2).",
            "Another striking output of the modeling is the wide range of potential trajectories for launch demand. This is highly dependent on which constellations materialize and to what degree. If the high-demand scenario plays out, demand would rise quickly and then gradually fall as constellations reach a steady stateâassuming there are no more new entrants. The trajectory in the base-case scenario would be slightly different, with demand peaking by 2028 and then remaining steady. In the low-case scenario, demand would remain around current levels up to 2027 and then dip briefly, since fewer of the concepts deployed require continuous replenishment. Starlinkâs evolution is a prominent factor in all scenarios.",
            "While demand dynamics are uncertain, launch is also at a tipping point. Many medium and heavy launch vehicles are being retired and most remaining capacity is already booked. ULAâs Atlas V has sold its remaining launches, and Arianespace has contracts for its remaining Ariane 5 flights. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is in the same position with its H2 vehicle, and Northrop Grummanâs final flight of its Antares 230+ is expected this year. Vehicles such as ISROâs SLV platform are available but will need to exceed launch rates achieved in recent years to keep pace with orders. This leaves Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy as the primary active medium and heavy launchers. Meanwhile, V2 Mini satellites allow SpaceX to move forward with its second-generation constellation while waiting for Starship capacity to come online.",
            "In the background, new launch capabilities are in development. Arianespace is developing Ariane 6, with plans for up to 11 launches per year and possibly more.",
            " ULA expects up to 30 launches a year, while Blue Origin anticipates a dozen or more launches a year on its New Glenn rocket.",
            " All three are aiming for first launches in 2023, but much of the capacity has also been reserved for Amazonâs Kuiper constellation and, in the case of ULA, the US National Security Space Launch program. MHI attempted the first launch of its H3 rocket in March 2023 but suffered a second-stage failure. The next attempt is not yet scheduled. Finally, companies including Firefly, Northrop Grumman, and Rocket Lab are planning new medium launch capacity that may come online as soon as 2024. Specific launch rates have yet to be disclosed.",
            "Looming over the market is SpaceXâs Starship, also expected to fly for the first time in 2023. When it reaches full capacity, SpaceX hopes to fly Starship every day, sending over 100 tons to orbit per launch. This kind of capability would fundamentally transform industry capacity and launch economics, with a promise of launch costs as low as $100 per kg to LEO.",
            "Of course, in space commerce, there is often a yawning gap between intention and execution. A rocket in development is not equivalent to being able to offer an immediate or scheduled ride into orbit. In all cases, we expect a significant ramp-up period, even after a successful first flight.",
            "As a guide to when new systems might add useful capacity, a potential benchmark is the historical lag between first flight and peak launch rate. In the medium- to heavy-size category, vehicles have typically seen a five-to-nine-year gap, with Falcon 9 being an outlier in that its launch rate is still rising. A major caveat to this approach is that there are many differences in the characteristics of individual programs, and in some cases, a full rate may have been limited more by demand than by a delay in production or operational ramp up. In addition, as the industry deploys new technologies and approaches, such as additive manufacturing and reusability, historical experience may be less directly relevant.",
            "Our Monte Carlo modeling suggests that, despite technological advances, new vehicles are unlikely to reach full capacity earlier than six years after first flight. Indeed, we believe new platforms such as Starship and New Glenn are likely to take longer than evolutionary launch vehicle families (e.g., Ariane 6, Vulcan) to get to peak performance, reflecting challenges expected with new designs.",
            "A âmost-likelyâ supply curve suggests an eventual surge in capacity as new players join the market and incumbents including Arianespace, MHI, SpaceX, and ULA bring vehicles online and ramp up launch rates, with Falcon 9 possibly reaching 100 or more annual launches in the near term (Exhibit 3).",
            "Looking ahead, as demand continues to rise, the medium segment may make up a smaller portion of launch as heavy and super-heavy supply (from Blue Origin, Relativity, and ULA, among others) rises and total supply increases. A significant factor in the capacity equation is the potential capabilities of Starship, which theoretically could offer a launch a day by 2030. Daily Starship launch is possible with a fleet size of 60 and just 15 reuses, and turnaround times slower than the historic bests of Falcon 9 for boosters and the space shuttle for orbital vehicles.",
            "Because the rate at which Starship will develop is uncertain, and because initial launches are likely to be heavily committed to Starlink, it is useful to consider a near-term scenario in which both Starship and full-size Starlink are excluded (Exhibit 4). While Falcon could continue in service, annual capacity across medium and heavy vehicles would reach a maximum of just five to six kilotons by 2030.",
            "The data, in aggregate, suggest that the space industry faces a potential double bind. In the short term, the most likely scenario is a capacity shortfall, but in the longer term, the biggest risk is oversupply.",
            "In the high-demand case, the shortfall would be up to 11,700 tons (equivalent to approximately 300 heavy or 800 medium vehicles) through 2025, implying that optimistic constellation deployment forecasts are unachievable in the near termâeven if financing, manufacturing, and other challenges are overcome. In our base case, a smaller but still significant shortfall in medium and heavy lift is likely over the next three years. Looking further ahead, Starship would be a game changer, if it meets its launch and reuse targets, with other providers adding to the surfeit of supply (Exhibit 5).",
            "Because of the outsize potential impact of SpaceX on both supply and demand, the industry should consider a scenario where Starship does not ramp up as expected and a full Starlink V2 deployment (which requires Starship) is delayed. In that scenario, with âbase-caseâ assumptions for other constellations, there would still be a short-term launch shortage; cumulatively about 3,000 tons or effectively a year of launches, unless SpaceX delays Starlink V2 mini deployments to serve other customers with Falcon (Exhibit 6). If, on the other hand, something like the low-demand scenario emerges, medium and heavy launch providers would have excess capacity near-term.",
            "As legacy vehicles ramp down and the industry transitions to next-generation platforms, a short-term supply shortage may open the window to a period of opportunity. Providers that can speedily ramp up their operational capabilities have a chance to capture market share, assuming vehicle reliability and the ability to control costs. In the longer term, as providers increase launch rates and vehicles become more reliable, there is a risk of oversupply, at which point cost control is likely to become a vital factor in remaining competitive.",
            "The best placed launch companies in this context will pursue strategies that maximize flexibility and cost control. This implies design and manufacturing approaches that allow for rapid deployment and scaling of capacity without incurring large fixed or variable costs, and operational approaches that reduce time to launch and associated labor costsâlikely leveraging reusability to drive the cost per launch as close as possible to the cost of fuel and vehicle maintenance. Safety and reliability will continue to be overarching concerns, suggesting excellent execution will be table stakes for a competitive launch company. Customer service, in terms of flexibility and tailoring of a launch to customer needs, could provide an advantage, as long as prices remain competitive. Longer-term or multiple launch contracts may be a way to provide certainty and could become more widespread than historic launch-by-launch deals.",
            "In an environment with uncertain but potentially large demand, there is significant near-term opportunity, but also considerable risk that a launch provider could be late to market and lose out to more nimble competitors. At the same time, the real chance of oversupply in the mid-term means cost control and the ability to economically dial back capacity must be a consideration from the start. As decision makers ponder their options, it will be vital to closely monitor the industryâs progress and take active steps to preempt potential outcomes.",

Three findings stand out (exhibit):",

Some companies are emerging as leaders, however, despite the fact that capital is not as readily available as it was a couple of years ago. These businesses create well-articulated, data-backed plans that describe how they can increase customer demand for the satellite offerings, and their solid preparation may help them obtain the capital required to achieve their constellation goals.

            "Facktor recently spoke with McKinseyâs Jess Harrington about her responsibilities at Airbus U.S., the future of the aerospace sector, and her experience as a woman in a male-dominated industry. Excerpts of their conversation follow. ",
            "First, tell me about your job. What areas are you focused on?",
            " Iâm an engineer by training, but I donât do engineering every day anymore. My job today is running our U.S. Space Systems line of business, which encompasses small satellites, human space flight, and space exploration. I manage a team of great people who understand all the technical aspects of building satellites and traveling out to space.  ",
            "The biggest part of my job is business development for our small satellites: showcasing our satellitesâ capabilities to customers. I sit on the board of Airbus OneWeb Satellites, which is our joint venture with [London-based communications company] OneWeb, so part of my job is providing leadership on the manufacturing sideâmaking sure that our satellites are built on time, on budget, at high quality. These days I spend a lot of my time on email, it seems, and on virtual phone calls. Iâm starting to do a little bit more travel, like to our factory in Florida where we make satellites.",
            "Another part of my job is overseeing our US human space flight and space exploration business. For example, Airbus invested in the Bartolomeo platform, which is a large, payload-hosting platform attached to the International Space Station. So, if a company or agency wants to send a payload out to spaceâsay, for Earth observation or for a scientific experimentâit can use our service. ",
            " Itâs amazing how many ",
            ". Iâd love your thoughts on where the space sector is headed in the coming years. What new kinds of economic activity might we see in space by 2030?",
            "Well, for one thing, I think there will be major advances in human space flight. Even in the past year, weâve seen great progress in the accessibility of space. In planning your 2030 vacation, you might be able to choose between taking a quick trip to Florida or taking ",
            ".",
            "In 2030, when thousands more satellites will be orbiting the Earth, a new opportunity in space might be the on-orbit servicing of satellites. Weâre starting to see some companies invest in [on-orbit] refueling or repair services, whether itâs to provide a propulsive boost to the correct orbit or to fix a dead battery. ",
            "Today, if your car breaks down on the side of the road at midnight, you can call a service like AAA [American Automobile Association]. You have their phone number; you trust them to come and jump your battery or repair your tire. Imagine you break down on that same road at midnight and a stranger comes up and says, âIâll fix your car.â Youâd probably say, âNo, thank you. Iâm going to wait until AAA comes or until the police come.â The same thing can happen in space: What is the trusted service for satellites? These are some of the issues for companies to work out. Itâs about building not just the technical pieces but also the trustworthiness that makes that kind of business model work.",
            "The notion of trustworthiness in space is interesting; it also comes into play when you think about the ",
            ". What do you see as the greatest threats to the continued growth in space activity between now and 2030?",
            "One is overcrowding in space. As you said, with all the ",
            "Â and the human space flight missions going on, thereâs more debris and a greater likelihood of things hitting each other. We need to be mindful of our behaviors in space when it comes to space debris. We need to be good neighbors. One of the principles of the US Forest Service, for example, is âpack it in, pack it outâ: if you go camping in the woods and create trash, you pack up that trash and bring it back out with you. We need to create those kinds of norms in space.",
            "Another concern is protection of information and cybersecurity. Weâre all worried about identity theft or spam in our emails, but what happens if our weather satellites start putting out spam? How does that affect airplanes during landing? Thatâs just one example. We need to protect both the physical assets and the way that data comes to us, because we rely on that data on a day-to-day basis. One promising technology is laser communication, which will enable more secure communications from one satellite to another, and also between satellites and the ground. When data is communicated via laser, itâs less easily intercepted or jammed than when youâre transmitting using radio frequencies.",
            " Who do you think will be providing space technologies? In other words, what will the space ecosystem look like in 2030? Will it be a mix of billionaire-backed start-ups and larger, traditional players like Airbus? ",
            "I think the space ecosystem in 2030 will still be a mix of government and industry players but maybe playing different roles. I believe thereâs always a role for the governmentâfirst of all, to ",
            "Â that perhaps has no direct commercial application but enables the next generation of STEM [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics] research and engenders creativity and learning. That will continue to be important. Government will take risks where industry is not able to and will continue to provide a reliable infrastructure, a common regulatory regime, and a predictable contractual and legal business environment. All of that is important for commercial companies to succeed. ",
            "Commercial companies, on the other hand, innovate by coming up with new applications for existing technologiesâincluding applications that we donât even know we need. The microwave oven didnât come about because somebody said, âI need to microwave my food.â You didnât even know you needed one until it existed; the same thing happened with the cell phone. ",
            "What weâre starting to see today, and what could happen frequently by 2030, is that those roles reverse: commercial companies will start challenging the assumptions that the government makes and investing a lot more in rapid-cycle R&D. The government might then take those commercial investments to a new level. Weâre already seeing a few examples of that, with the government taking advantage of commercial launch vehicles and commercial investments in low-Earth-orbit satellites, like those we are building in our factory in Merritt Island, Florida. ",
            "Obviously, given the heightened interest and activity in space, the industry will need to attract more talent. What does the ideal 2030 space workforce look like, and what needs to happen to make it look that way? ",
            "I love the fact that young people are still excited about space and want to come into our industry. Many little kids want to become astronauts. I hope that, in schools, we continue to encourage young people to be successful in math, science, and technical fields but also recognize that other fields are needed in the space industry. People who know how to communicate, people who know how to draw up contracts, experts in political science, experts in the artsâthese are all important parts of our space ecosystem.",
            "One of the most important things we can do is to continue to invest in talent and encourage young peopleâespecially women and underrepresented minoritiesâto go into fields like aerospace. There are a number of new fellowships designed to help make the aerospace industry a more diverse and dynamic environment, and the individuals who become alumni of these fellowships are going to change the world. I really want to see space companies and agencies have equal representation of women and minorities.",
            " Thereâs already so much competition in the space sector, and itâs only going to intensify. What do you think will differentiate companies by 2030? Will it be technology? Will it be an operating model? Or some combination of those factors? ",
            "The number one way for a company to differentiate itself is through its culture and how it treats people. The environment you create inside your company is a reflection of the service and product that you deliver to your customers and shareholders. A company can have great technologies but then execute poorly because the culture isnât there. Conversely, a semi-good idea that people think is just so-soâif you put it with the right team that has the passion and ability to innovateâcan turn out beyond all expectations.",
            "So I donât think the differentiator will be a particular technology or business model. Itâs all about the people and the experience. If you have a good experience, regardless of what the product or service is, and the people are enjoying what they do while delivering it, thatâs what makes for a good company. Companies with a strong, positive, and inclusive culture are the ones that will survive.",

        "paragraphs": [
            " the food and agriculture sector has consistently faced challenges in meeting the worldâs food needs. Throughout the late 20th century, population growth significantly increased global demand for nutrition, and as the 21st century has progressed, severe weather events as a result of climate change have complicated food production around the world.",
            "Despite these challenges, participants in the food value chainâincluding farmers, agribusinesses, processors, and distributorsâhave made great strides in increasing overall per capita caloric availability. However, they have not yet overcome environmental challenges associated with food and agriculture. In fact, in 2019 the worldâs agri-food systems accounted for about 30 percent of human-caused global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, making them a critical focus for meeting increasingly bold climate targets.",
            "One opportunity to meet climate targets while adding new revenue in agriculture is to remove carbon through regenerative agricultural practices such as planting cover crops. Such carbon removals could sequester 0.5 to 1.2 metric gigatons (Gt) of CO",
            " out of the 6.0 to 10.0 GtCO",
            " of annual sequestration needed by 2050.",
            " They can also help agriculture play a critical role in addressing other sustainability crises, such as biodiversity loss, nutrient pollution, and freshwater consumption.",
            "That said, public incentives are forcing many companies to rethink their business models and pursue innovation. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States addresses climate mitigation and agriculture, consumer willingness to pay green premiums is increasing, and voluntary carbon markets have been established in the state of California, the European Union, and the United Kingdom.",
            "In mid to late 2022, we surveyed 162 industry professionals: 87 representing food, agriculture, and agtech, and 75 from investment groups, incubators, and other financial organizations. Respondents spanned the globe, coming from North and South America; AsiaâPacific; and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. We asked these professionals about how they expect agriculture to evolve in the coming years and which of the five shifts identified will be the most significant, as well as their reactions to 11 business concepts and how each can disrupt incumbentsâ operations today.",
            "Moving forward, significant shifts in global food systems are necessary to meet the worldâs demand for food, fuel, and fiber without harming the planetâand innovation at scale is key. With this in mind, we surveyed some of the sectorâs leading thinkers, including executives of incumbent companies, venture capital (VC) firms, and start-ups, to get their thoughts on five recent shifts (see sidebar âAbout the surveyâ). The results helped us identify 11 food and agriculture business concepts that are emerging to support the future of farming and to meet the sectorâs sustainability challenges for a green and resilient future.",
            "As the food and agriculture sector approaches the future, regulatory environments and private-sector commitments could be major drivers of change. On the regulatory side are ambitious policy agendas; for example, the European Commissionâs Farm to Fork Strategy, part of the European Green Deal, aims to make food systems âfair, healthy, and environmentally friendlyâ by promoting organic farming and pushing for a 50 percent reduction in synthetic inputs.",
            " Meanwhile, more than 1,500 corporations have made emissions-reduction commitments through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), including many companies in the food and agriculture sector.",
            " And many of these companies have gone even further to focus on broader environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, including regenerative farming, reduced waste, water quality, and biodiversity.",
            "Based on these commitments, five shifts are needed to support the goals of 21st-century food and agriculture: building land value beyond crops, fueling the biorevolution, eating sustainably, ESG transparency and accountability, and taking out the waste. Of the five key shifts, survey respondents said three present particular challenges for incumbent agribusinesses (Exhibit 1).",
            "Change is coming fast. In fact, 50 percent of respondents expect these shifts to have a meaningful impact on the industry within the next two years, while approximately 20 percent believe these shifts already have impact today. Investors expect shifts to occur faster than incumbents do. Overall, respondents believe the greatest material impact will come from eating sustainably and ESG transparency and accountability (both at 58 percent of respondents), followed by fueling the biorevolution (55 percent), taking out the waste (53 percent), and building land value beyond crops (47 percent).",
            "Despite the challenges these shifts present, leading and new agribusinesses will have meaningful opportunities to pursue business-building opportunities. In our discussions with survey respondents, we identified 11 business concepts that will be key to feeding the world sustainably (Exhibit 2).",
            "Land is a limited resource that can provide direct benefits from production as well as indirect benefits from passive use, such as increased biodiversity and naturally occurring carbon sinks in the form of forests and oceans. Landowners, farmers, input providers, and other value chain participants can consider comprehensive aspects of land valuation, including those with benefits that may take more time to materialize.",
            " The importance of cropland is expanding beyond conventional crop production in recognition of the vital role that climate-smart agriculture can play in supporting both stakeholders and decarbonization. Practices that sequester carbon and reduce biodiversity loss can create benefits such as soil preservation for farmers and can also create new revenue streams, such as carbon credits, for landowners, farmers, and investors.",
            "An incumbent in the agri-food sector has set out to provide sustainable farming as a service. It leverages its advantages as an incumbent to help smaller farmers overcome challenges of scale, such as the following:",
            " Agriculture is a uniquely slow sector for commercial innovation because farmers tend to operate on a seasonal basis. This can create lags in revenue that are difficult for new ventures to endure and that encourage incumbents to focus on the core business instead of on reinvention.",
            " Farmers often have significant capital tied up in their operations as well as debt on their land and equipment. Naturally, there is a high bar to change practices or try new technologies that could risk cash flow and lead to default. At the same time, farming is a complicated business, and most farmers are making many simultaneous decisions around equipment, crop mix and rotation, inputs (such as type, supplier, application rate, and application timing), crop marketing, compliance reporting, labor, and more.",
            " Incumbents have an unfair advantage, with access to talent, capital, and farmers that start-ups and other new entrants do not have. However, it is critical to give the new business space to grow to keep it from being smothered by the existing processes or biases of the parent organization.",
            " Regenerative agronomy supports the deployment of regenerative agriculture, which can help sequester carbon, reduce biodiversity loss, reduce freshwater use, and decrease nutrient pollution. Despite the recent launch of numerous new ventures to support decarbonization on the farm, businesses have not yet achieved significant scale or fully succeeded in supporting farmers in the transition to regenerative agriculture. However, capital is ready to be deployed: investors expect to increase fund allocation of new farming methods by 15 percent in their next rounds of funding, indicating that they recognize the importance of regenerative agriculture. This area urgently needs to be scaled so that farmers have the right incentives and do not get left behind (see sidebar âHow incumbents can help smaller players implement sustainable practicesâ).",
            " Service models can support smallholder farmers in making the transition from low-productivity, extensive agriculture to high-productivity, intensive, climate-smart agriculture. More than three-quarters of farmers around the world live on less than two hectaresâmeaning millions of farmers do not produce enough to earn a sufficient income or use their land effectively.",
            " For example, the yields of US corn farmers are 11 times those in sub-Saharan Africa, three to four times those in India, and nearly twice those in China, which is the second-largest producer in the world.",
            " Smallholders are exposed to climate risks such as drought, extreme heat, and floodingâfor example, nearly 80 percent of all smallholders in Ethiopia, India, and Mexico could be affected by at least one climate hazard by 2050.",
            " With an estimated one-third of the worldâs food and 32 percent of agriculture GHG emissions coming from smallholder farms, solving the smallholder challenge will be imperative for both food security and climate needs. Solving this challenge could increase land productivity, reduce conversion rates of natural ecosystems to farmland to produce carbon sequestration and biodiversity benefits, and ensure climate-smart agriculture practices.",
            "Production systems have become increasingly efficient over time, but there is still significant headroom to increase efficiency in the biofuel space as demand accelerates. For example, the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects US biofuel consumption in 2030 to triple compared with 2019 levels.",
            " Thus, food and agriculture players can accelerate improvements to meet climate targets and emerging demands.",
            "Raising capital has been one of the most significant challenges for the CEO of a start-up cleantech player converting manure to biogas and biofertilizer. With this in mind, he shared several lessons from the companyâs journey.",
            " The simpler the business model and the pitch, the better. Decision makers will have different levels of familiarity with specific business models, so make it easy for them to understand the business and its unique value proposition.",
            " Capital-raising teams should have experience with similar businessesâthose with similar technology, end markets, and maturity. A team with the right experience can save precious time in raising capital by knowing where to go first. For example, American private equity funds may prefer different risk profiles than European private equity funds or smaller environmental, social, and governance funds.",
            " Avoid getting too excited about one potential investor such that you slow down discussions with others. Itâs important to have many irons in the fire because hiccups on the path to âyesâ are common.",
            " At first, partnerships can appear to dilute the value a company expects to capture. However, they can be an important way to de-risk and reduce the complexity of a business. Although itâs still important to understand potential trade-offs, partnerships also signal to potential investors that others have bought into a business.",
            " By 2030, the world is expected to produce nearly five billion tons of manure each year.",
            " On the one hand, this volume is a potential environmental problem that could affect air and water quality due to nitrous oxide and methane emissions. On the other hand, manure could potentially meet crop fertility needs, improve soil quality, and deliver significant amounts of energyâenough to contribute 5.5 percent of national energy production by 2050.",
            " However, the challenge of producing, aggregating, and marketing this volume of organic fertilizer is not trivial (see sidebar âConsiderations for start-ups raising capitalâ). Many farms lack the necessary scale for the economics of current approaches to be feasible. For example, only 10 percent of the approximately 60,000 dairy farms in France are of sufficient scaleâaround 100 cowsâfor small anaerobic digesters to make economic sense.",
            " Some sectors are particularly difficult to abate, such as the transportation sector, especially aviation. A number of promising technologies are on the horizon, such as hydrogen-powered flight, but most are a decade or more away from scaling. Meeting our growing needs for fuel will likely require upgrading existing biofuel technologies and scaling nascent technology approaches such as conversion of crop and forest residues to sustainable fuels through advanced pyrolysis.",
            " In turn, this will require careful management to ensure feedstocks are truly sustainably sourced and do not reduce carbon stocks or damage biodiversity. However, this space could provide excellent opportunities for new green businesses that have the dual mission of creating both value and social impact.",
            "Efficiently producing food will not be enough. At the global level, diets will need to shift toward more sustainable sources of energy and protein. That said, some of these shifts are already happening today. For example, the alternative-protein revolution is currently in the early phase as companies develop and scale plant-based proteins.",
            " These can be complemented by cultivated meats, plant-based meats, and other innovations to help meet consumer demand for tasty, healthy foods at lower carbon- and land-intensity per calorieâup to 20 times less than for beef.",
            " Alternative proteins and other plant-based foods have been a strong growth area, with numerous start-ups launching products targeting the sweet spot of tasty, trendy, and more sustainably produced. However, these supply chains remain subscale, resulting in higher costs than those of incumbent foods and ingredients. In turn, these supply constraints and high costs limit the appetite of food companies to launch new products.",
            " Not all consumers will make the shift to plant-based proteins.",
            " Thus, new businesses will need to be geared toward alternative proteins, such as lab-grown (cultured) meat alternatives. The lab-grown meat space could represent more than $25 billion in value by 2030.",
            " However, consumers have strong preferences on what meat should look, feel, and taste like, which creates challenges for lab-grown-meat providers in meeting consumer expectations.",
            "As the saying goes, âWhat gets measuredÂ gets managed.â Nearly 30 percent of the food produced today is wastedâenough to feed two billion people, more than double the undernourished population across the globe.",
            " Given this scale, reducing waste will be a critical component of the future food system. Solutions will likely involve preserving crops at the farm level and reducing food waste at the processing, retail, and consumer levels, all of which can lead to capturing more value from food production.",
            " Unavailability of cold storage drives significant food waste. Up to 50 and 45 percent of postharvest output in India and Nigeria spoils because of a lack of cold storage, respectively.",
            " Building solar-powered cold-store solutions can help increase microstorage or aggregation solutions for smallholder farms, reducing postharvest losses for remote farmers without connection to the grid.",
            " A new method called hyperbaric storage, which uses pressure control to slow microbial development at different temperatures, could serve as an alternative to cold storage.",
            " Even if food is not consumed by humans, it can still play important roles such as feeding animals. It can also be converted into energy or other products through techniques such as waste-to-energy, renewable natural gas (RNG), conversion to biochar for soil, and compost. For example, codigestion, anaerobic digestion, and composting can mitigate 0.5 to 0.6 tons of CO",
            " equivalent per ton of food waste while reducing waste disposal fees.",
            " Meanwhile, incumbent waste players typically use anaerobic digestion to convert food waste into a slurry to produce biogas, RNG, or compost.",
            " Climate change is changing the risk profile of farms. There is a need for good quantification of risk factors to support land acquisition, farm finance, and other decisions. This would ideally allow more preferential access to capital for farmers with less systematic risk who have taken measures to build climate resilience (such as through regenerative agriculture practices). One example is the EPAâs monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) plan, which provides an approved method for plant owners and operators to report the amount of CO",
            " that is sequestered.",
            " Indirect land use change and soil carbon sequestration have only recently been included in key emissions tracking metrics. For example, SBTiâs Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) Guidance was announced in fall 2022 for companies in land-intensive sectors to set near-term science based targets.Â New and more-accurate methodologies for end-to-end supply chain tracking of emissions and other important sustainability metrics, such as carbon accounting, can support a net-zero pathway and help farmers and food manufacturers build consumer trust in new green products and brands.",
            "While regulation will undoubtedly play a major role in supporting the transition, the largest force for scaling a sustainable transformation in food and agriculture is arguably private-sector innovation, especially business model innovation. We are seeing capital being deployed at scale by incumbents and by new ventures. On the venture side, capital deployment has been remarkable, with 20 times more capital invested in agtech ventures in 2021 than in 2012.",
            " Investors are changing how they plan to allocate capital in their next funds, with new technologies such as new farming methods and production foodtech seeing growth at the cost of less novel areas such as traditional production and agricultural inputs. Overall, investors are more excited about concepts that are more mature, while incumbents prefer close-to-farm initiatives (Exhibit 3).",
            "Agribusiness leaders can respond to these shifts by making several adjustments in how they think and operate",
            ":",
            "Although the future evolution of food needs remains uncertain, itâs exceedingly clear that urgent action is needed to respond to climate change and ensure that healthy sources of nutrition are available globally. There is significant pressure to get this rightâand quickly. Businesses will need to be scaled to allow both incumbents and new entrants to adapt, and many of the concepts they will bring to the table are expected to achieve scale over the next three to five years. Decisions made today will have lasting implications, but a healthy understanding of the trends, players, and technologies involved can help plant the seeds for increasingly sustainable quantities of affordable and nutritious food.",

            "Grew up in Paarl, a small town in the Western Cape of South Africa. Has lived in the United Kingdom since 2001. In addition to being CEO of Westfalia Fruit, Brand is also the CEO of Hans Merensky Holdings and a member of the boards of both companies.",
            "Â ",
            "Westfalia Fruitâs history traces back to the 1920s, when it originated on a small farm in Limpopo, South Africa. The company now claims to have the largest avocado-growing footprint in the world, with farms in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Its vertically integrated operations span 16 countries and encompass research, cultivation, processing, packing, and shipping. In addition to avocados, the company markets guacamole, avocado oils, and other fruits (including mangoes, pomegranates, and blueberries) to customers in more than 50 countries.",
            "Brand recently spoke with Imran Manji, formerly an associate partner at McKinsey, about focusing on end consumers, preparing for climate change, and meeting the challenge of supplying avocados all over the worldâevery week of the year. An edited version of their conversation follows.",
            " Youâve had consistent growth over the years in your core business and core markets. For most companies, however, it eventually ",
            ". Product and category adjacencies are the most common avenues for finding growth. But the trajectory of growth at Westfalia has in large part come from geographic adjacencies, as youâve taken it from a single-market player to now the largest avocado company in the world. How did you bring that expansion to life?",
            " Every company wants to grow. But you cannot do it if you donât have a sound core. You might think you should start looking at new opportunities in adjacent markets, or even adjacent categories, but if you donât have a very strong and stable core, built over generations of expertise, then youâre going to struggle.",
            "Our focus has always been to be either the number-one or number-two player in a core market before we move into a market adjacent to it. And then when we move into adjacent markets, we do so with clear information and knowledge about what the adjacent market will do for our business. On the supply side, we are the worldâs largest investor in avocado research, which enables quantification of some of our risk.",
            " Many players fail when theyâre trying to grow through geographic adjacencies, often delivering below-average portfolio growth. Youâre not only managing the general volatility of entering into a new market but also the specific challenges of conducting business in that particular market. How do you create a repeatable, reliable growth formula thatâs centered on geographic adjacencies?",
            " There are different types of risk whenever we contemplate entering a new market. But there are two things we will never allow to happenâeven if the investment opportunity is wonderful. One is that we will never compromise the safety of our staff. And the other is that we will never compromise the reputation of our business, which we have built over a long, long time. So we do thorough diligence on everything before we make a decision.",
            "We believe that our mission when we enter new markets is not only to make money, which is table stakes, but also to create something meaningful in communities. Iâll use the example of Mozambique. We were the first company of size to farm at large scale there. We created employment for a lot of people. But we also gave small growers the opportunity to farm and become businesspeople in their own right.",
            "A prime reason why we invested in Mozambique was to make sure that our objective of supplying our markets 52 weeks a year would be properly met. In our research, we discovered that Mozambique has a very favorable delivery window into other markets known as seasonal pinch points, where avocados can sometimes be in short supply. In our agronomical studies, we examined where the best place in Mozambique would be to farm. We researched infrastructure, available skills, and trainable skills. Pilot studies were conducted. When we were happy with the result of those studies, we made serious capital available for the investment.",
            " You have had a long history with ",
            "Â [consumer-packaged-goods] companies. In that world, when it comes to delivering products to consumers, a lot of the variables are relatively controlled. But now that youâre also in the agriculture industry, you need to deal with the harsh realities of commodity cycles. How have you brought CPG principles into the agriculture industry while dealing with the different challenges it entails?",
            " One of the common things you will see in the ",
            "Â is that itâs very production focused. You need to be the leader in your agricultural specialtyâin our case, avocados and a few other fruitsâso you can be a supplier of quality products.",
            "But at the end of the process, the product needs to get to a consumer. Very analogous to CPG, you need to ensure that shelves arenât empty and that your retail partners are happy because your consumers are happy. I hope one of the things Iâve done successfully is to link that supply and demand side properly. Our business has radically changed over time and is now absolutely a consumer-focused business.",
            "There are three separate elements we deal with. First, we need to have a product. In the world of fast-moving consumer goods, you can generally produce that product with a machine. But we have to plant a tree and then wait patiently for three to five years for that tree to produce enough quality fruit to send somewhere. Second, on the opposite side of this process, we have consumers. We supply them mainly through a platform of retailers and food service outlets. And third, in the middle, we have a logistical platform.",
            "We really need to be masters of all three. Being consumer centric, and understanding consumer needs, makes it easier to take a company through a transition period in which itâs moved from being focused on the farming sideâwhich is still very, very importantâto connecting that with the consumer on the other side. Because, in the end, itâs all about what consumers need. If you canât meet that need, youâre not going to be successful.",
            " Over time, competitive intensity in any industry grows. Competitors move fast, and elements that used to be differentiated can become transactional. How do you maintain your competitive differentiation?",
            " Last year we experienced floods, drought, hail, and tropical storms all over the world. Before that, we had to deal with supply chain dilemmas arising from the RussiaâUkraine situation. And before that, we had to handle COVID-19. During all these challenges, all of our customers were supplied on time, in full, 52 weeks a year. Itâs what we promise to them. A consumer makes the effort to go to a store because theyâve got a product in mindâideally, avocadosâand if they canât find that product itâs a big disappointment for them.",
            "The ability to connect hundreds of global supply touchpoints and deliver product to our consumers 52 weeks a year is, I think, still something that differentiates us. So we focus intently on that. To keep our customers supplied, we diversify our footprint all over the world, in terms of farming. Our research program identifies new varieties of avocados that are more resilient, and more resistant against plant disease. And we of course pay fanatical attention to detail in terms of our supply chain.",
            "Another advantage we have is that we work closely with our retail customers, in partnership with themâespecially with our top 20 or 30 customers globally. We work with them in terms of research, category management, and making sure that we understand what the consumer wants. We try to make sure that our retailers are a destination for consumers because consumers have a level of trust with them. We want to collaborate with retail customers in ways that let them meet the evolving needs of consumers in terms of convenience, promotions, ESG [environmental, social, and governance]-related concerns, and omnichannel retailing.",
            "Performance is, in the end, the decision maker between a retailer staying with us or moving to a competitor. We have to make sure that we perform better than anybody else. We are fanatical about our service levels, our quality, and our attention to KPIs. If there are customer complaints, we work hard to understand why they are happening and what we can do about it.",
            " In terms of diffusing risk, one of the components that youâve talked about is ",
            "Â and how itâs affecting different geographies. How have you built climate research into your decision making and ultimately managed that risk?",
            " The effects of climate change are undeniable. Weâre already seeing them in our business. We work with institutions all over the world to see if we can use artificial intelligence to make better predictions about climate events.",
            "Because we have to assume that climate change will continue, we need to be geographically diversified to make sure that our customers can be served from many territories at the same time. We also have to assume that certain resources, such as water, will become less and less available. Through our research program, we are creating varieties of avocados that need less water. Also, weâre looking for the most effective ways to conserve water in irrigation. We might eventually need to decide that itâs not wise to farm avocados in certain areas, but I hope that that never happens.",
            "Meanwhile, we do everything we can to make sure that we are a responsible global citizen. For instance, we ensure that our packaging is as sustainable as possible. And we have developed partnerships to use ground avocado seeds in beauty products, replacing plastic microbeads that were previously used as exfoliator agents.",
            " Whatâs next on the horizon for you? Where is the company headed?",
            " Thereâs a lot of good work still to be done in the United States. We feel that there are great opportunities, especially in the Midwest and on the East Coast, so weâre going to work hard to bring extra consumers from those regions to the category. In Europe, there are several countries, including Italy, Spain, and all the Eastern European countries, that still havenât seen avocados in the way we present them. We feel we can offer better quality, value, consistency, availability, and ethical and environmental assurances.",
            "We penetrated India a few years ago, after proper research. Weâve got a solid business there, with our own farms, nursery, and commercial team. Our focus at the moment in India is on the big cities.",
            "Weâre also looking for new worlds to enter. And the new worlds for us are in AsiaâChina, Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia. We have already done our homework. And at the right time we will trigger a movement into those markets. Our vision is to make avocados available to every consumer in the world, and we are able to fast-track development in target countries using the experience weâve garnered from our fully integrated global operations.",

        "paragraphs": [
            " is the vice president of Bovaer, a methane-reducing feed additive, at Swiss-Dutch nutrition, health, and beauty company dsm-firmenich. Joshua Katz, a McKinsey partner and leader in the agriculture and private equity space, and Wilson Roen, a McKinsey consultant and sustainability fellow, talked with Mark about the development of Bovaer, how the agriculture industry can encourage further adoption among farmers, and what the world can do to support critical sustainability and decarbonization initiatives.",
            " Thinking back to the start of Bovaer, what inspired the deep dive into product development? How would you characterize where you are today and where youâre going?",
            " About 15 years ago, we were considering our future innovation themes, and one of those themes was how to respond to human-induced climate change. From there, people brought their ideas, one of which was reducing methane emissions from cattle.",
            "Now fast forward to just over a year ago: the so-called Clean Cow project came to fruition with its first market approvals in Brazil and Chile. Today, Bovaer is available in more than 45 markets, with availability in the United States expected sometime in the first half of next year. So weâve seen tremendous acceleration on the market-approval side.",
            "In recent years, food processors, retailers, and food and beverage companies started to lower their CO",
            "e [carbon dioxide equivalent] emissions, and with dairy and beef having such large footprints, these were areas in which companies tried to reduce their emissionsâfor example, through knowledge sharing and incentivizing farmers for their sustainability practices.",
            "More recently, methane became a big topic. Just look at the Global Methane Pledge, in which more than 150 countries have agreed to lower methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030.",
            " Before that, everybody was looking at CO",
            " and CO",
            "e. Now, singling out what needs to happen with methane has created additional momentum, with countries and the first companies aligning their targets with the Pledge.  Solutions to reduce methane emissions have become increasingly important, and this is exactly where Bovaer fits in.",
            "To put all of this into perspective, over the past eight months or so, Bovaer has saved approximately 40,000 metric tons of CO",
            "e. This year, weâll exceed 100,000 metric tons, and weâll soon reach millions of metric tons.",
            " How are farmers thinking about and adopting Bovaer? And how are you engaging the broader ecosystem to encourage adoption?",
            " There are two main questions from farmers. The first is, âDoes Bovaer affect animal performance?â The answer is no. But itâs always important to confirm that. The second question is, âWho pays for it?â On this point, weâve been working with players across the value chain to facilitate either paying farmers directly or reimbursing them later on. If itâs a cost-neutral operation and thereâs no negative performance impact, many farmers are much more willing to make a change. This is primarily because they themselves are affected by climate change. Anything they can do to avoid climate change is important. Itâs also a license to operate in certain geographies. And finally, thereâs a willingness to do things better, particularly with the younger generation.",
            "Adoption should be encouraged downstream and across the broader ecosystem. Regarding downstream, we need to inform processors, retailers, and food-services companies. That means communicating that a solution is available, that itâs manageable from a cost perspective, and that thereâs an immediate ability to make a significant impact. And regarding the broader ecosystem, itâs a matter of making sure people are recognized for their carbon or methane reductions. That means thinking through how information flows and how to handle verification, among other things.",
            "Itâs also increasingly important to think about making these reductions visible at the country level. Even though we launched less than a year ago, there are countries where we are already reaching adoption of up to 7 percent of all dairy cows. If you take a 30 percent reduction on those emissions, that can translate to a 1 to 2 percent reduction in emissions from dairy cattle in those countries.",
            "And the last part is working with the farmers and the nutritionists so they can make informed decisions on how to implement the product. As an example, we mix Bovaer into the mineral mixes, the vitamin mixes, or any other feed source that already goes to the farm. This means the farmer has no additional handling responsibilities. The only additional thing they need to do is take a picture of the invoice for certification reasons. And in the future, this could even be done through APIs. The more burdens you take away and really fit into the normal day-to-day practices, the easier it is.",
            " What does the world need to do for us to move from the 7 percent range to a much higher number?",
            " Although 2030 targets help, itâs even more helpful if companies also have 2025 and 2027 targets; otherwise, itâs easy to put off implementation until late 2029. If you do that, nobody will build capacity because they wonât believe the market is there. A line of sight and interim reduction ambitions or targets can help build the market over time.",
            "Today, there are a lot of different rules and applications and different ways of calculating reductions. Therefore, some standardization across players and markets would be helpful. Showing footprints is becoming a requirement for supply and trade deals. Even supermarkets are starting to ask, âWhatâs the footprint of this product?â If five different companies have five different ways of calculating their footprints, it makes it difficult for a supermarket to prioritize their decisions. Some supermarkets are going one step further and are demanding their suppliers to join the Science Based Target initiative [SBTi] ",
            " and instructing them on how to report.",
            "Moving forward, the transition thatâs currently happening from offsetting to insetting, or the reduction emissions in the value chain, will play an enormous role. Historically, people have thought, âLet me sell to the highest buyer,â which meant many reductions were moving beyond the agricultural food processing chain. Also, many companies inside the value chain were simply buying the cheapest offset available. Now, with the rule changesâamong others based on SBTisâreductions will need to be realized and stay in the chain. This will accelerate the transition.",
            "At the end of day, thereâs a lot of moneyâsubsidies, government funds, grants, and philanthropyâthat still goes to research for additional solutions. This money is mainly used for research, but thereâs too little emphasis and investment into early movers that exist today. If the market and ecosystem is established and proven, innovation will always follow, so itâs important to sufficiently spend time and money on market creation. Just to be clear, Iâm not saying we shouldnât do research. Itâs more a matter of rebalancing that research to stimulate early adoption and support.",
            "Lastly, appropriate regulatory frameworks and speed in regulatory reviews are needed to support early adopters and make them the champions. Appropriate regulatory frameworks will help make sure people who make a change are consistently recognized for their efforts.",
            " On the point of early adoption of these types of technologies, are there geographies that youâre more excited about or where there is more movement?",
            " One region that has been an early and rapid adopter is Australia, which we did not expect at all. This means that once we got into the market, we had absolutely no inventory in place. Considering the container challenges over the past year, getting inventory to Australia was quite difficult.",
            "That said, the reason for increased adoption in Australia is thereâs an industry that has very clear 2030 targets. The meat and livestock sector in Australia has set carbon-neutral targets. Thatâs extremely ambitious, but it does foster a few things. For instance, the larger beef processors know that this target is starting and therefore say, âHow can I pilot things that are coming up?â So you have a group of early adopters.",
            "Thereâs also an extensive research infrastructure in the countryâdifferent research institutes, different ways of measuring methane reductionsâwhich allows many groups to do things in parallel. Furthermore, thereâs quite a bit of funding available from both a scientific and early commercialization perspective, which again helps companies get started. The fact that they also signed the Global Methane Pledge recently also helps.",
            "To summarize: thereâs a clear target. Thereâs research infrastructure, which supports the adoption. Thereâs early money to help companies that are actually willing to make a change because they still see potential.",
            " What other kinds of decarbonization opportunities are you excited about?",
            " To continue off the previous point, thereâs a lot of exciting research happening about how to reach more animals. I often get asked, âWhy are you still spending money on innovation when youâve already solved it?â Well, weâre essentially spending money on how to reach the next cow. And finding different ways of feeding, different forms, and different formulations.",
            "Feed additives tend to work well in advanced markets: the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan, and Koreaâmaybe China, as well. There are large numbers of cattle in many other countries, each with different conditions. In many of those countries, the first question should be how to improve productivity. For example, how do you get the cows that are in Africa and India to produce a bit more milk? Hopefully, this means needing fewer cows as the global population grows.",
            "The fact that biogas digesters become increasingly attractive at smaller scale also plays a big role. Historically, the big systems made sense; but nowadays, smaller systems also make sense from an economic perspective, which has significant untapped potential in many markets. And leveraging that either through miniaturization or by pooling different groups together to use one digester will be another key lever.",

            "âMany shrimp farmers are still operating with highly manual processes and uncertainty in decision making,â explains McKinsey engagement director and associate partner Melissa Fitts. âSo there was a huge opportunity to help them standardize, automate, and optimize their practices, helping them increase efficiency in their production.â",
            "Compared with other industries, shrimp was falling behind in the use of technology, not only in farming but also across the value chain. âTo collect data and train the models, we had to digitize information written out with pen and paper,â says Fitts.",
            "In addition to providing an analytics solution, McKinsey set out to develop a full digital ecosystem that would not only leverage global best practices through predictive models but also adapt to specific field conditions and empower farmers by creating a solution specially tailored to their needs. âThe ecosystem integrates hardware, software, and field technical skills to create a comprehensive solution that optimizes productive practices and increases profitability while easing farmers into the new technology,â says Jorge Grieve, McKinsey leading partner of the program.",
            "The solution comprises Internet of Things (IoT) equipment such as automatic feeders, sensors, and hydrophones to collect real-time data and standardize feed distribution; a set of predictive analytics models to optimize quantity and time of feed based on pool conditions and shrimp characteristics; and a technical-advisory service that helps implement the solution in the field. âWhat makes this project unique is the contrast of using IoT and AI algorithms in an industry that was using manual calculations no longer than a year ago,â explains Simon Tamayo, data-science expert and techlead of the project.",
            "âThe effect of one cannot be separated from the other,â says McKinsey engagement manager Georgina Jabbour, explaining how the ecosystem has performed. âIt is the combination of automation, data-driven decision making, and technical expertise that generates unprecedented levels of biomass in a shorter period of time.â",
            "McKinsey has helped deploy the solution across approximately 300 hectares of shrimp ponds, achieving a median increase in biomass of 16 percentâat a higher growth rateâand reducing production cycles by as much as 15 percent. âShrimp farmers are starting to understand the impact of technology in their practice and are now actively looking for partners who can help them transform their operations,â says Jabbour. âFrom the smallest to the largest producers, farmers are finding a huge opportunity to increase their profitability.â",
            "In this context, what was once a way for aquaculture players to differentiate themselves has now become a ticket to play. Global players have reacted to the offering and are actively contributing to the technological revolution in shrimp farming. âIt all started from a very specific question for a client, which turned into a massively transformative project not only for the client but also for the industry,â says Pepe Cafferata, a McKinsey partner and head of QuantumBlack in Latin America.",
            "Moving forward, there are large opportunities that can be captured. Todayâs advanced-analytics models are constantly evolvingâand will continue to learn as the digital ecosystem provides data for the next generation. âWe have created a data-driven culture,â says Tamayo. âOur clientâs analytics team is already working on including new variables that can affect shrimp growth, and together, we have established a road map for exploration to continue revolutionizing the industry.â"

            " For this report, our research has focused on how decarbonization measures have evolved, as well as on the key barriers to their adoption and the actions industry players and investors can take to support their uptake. At the same time, conversations about sustainable transitions have increasingly focused on agricultureâs effects on nature and society beyond climate change. For example, agricultural land covers half of all habitable land and is responsible for 70 percent of freshwater withdrawals.",
            " In addition, food systems are the primary driver of biodiversity loss around the world, and these systems have growing effects on biosphere integrity, human health, and food access.",
            " While climate change remains the focus of this report, decarbonization and the actions to achieve it cannot be considered separately from their broader impacts on nature and society. Trade-offs and other benefits associated with decarbonization actions are highlighted throughout the report.",
            "Achieving a 1.5Â° pathway will require actions that extend beyond the farm throughout the value chain. Chief among these actions are reducing food loss and waste, adopting dietary shifts, and adapting how we use arable land, all of which are critical to decarbonization and will help the industry meet global food needs while maintaining the livelihoods of farmers (Exhibit 1).",
            "Changing how we farm, the focus of this report, is critical to a successful transition. Building on our previous work, we have defined 28 measures that can support decarbonization on the farm while creating potential value for the industry and farmers (Exhibit 2). Together, these measures have an annual emissions-reduction of approximately 2.2 GtCO",
            ". Many of these measures can be implemented at little to no cost to the farmer and have benefits beyond emissions reductions, including yield and biodiversity uplift.",
            "Although a 1.5Ë pathway exists and can create value for farmers and the broader industry, meaningful barriers are preventing adoption of decarbonization solutions at scale. Farmers are central to the sustainability transition, but they do not yet have sufficient incentives to adopt new methods and technologies. Emissions tracing and other actions require new, innovative solutions to facilitate decarbonization. And there is much room to grow in helping farmers overcome challenges in scaling their operations and maintaining profitability.",
            "The findings in this report can guide food and agriculture organizations as they transition to increased sustainability. Each intervention should be tailored to its specific context, but broadly speaking, change requires the following:",
            "The food and agriculture value chain has a chance to create a more sustainable ecosystem that feeds a growing planet while maintaining the livelihoods of farmers. With tailored and concentrated action, industry players, policy makers, and investors can accelerate the path to this future while enabling their own growth.",
            "Although the path to achieving 1.5ËC will not be straightforward, it can create real business value for farmers and players throughout the value chain, with additional environmental benefits beyond reducing climate change. Action will be required beyond the farm, but there is a real opportunity to drive on-farm decarbonization while capturing business value. A more sustainable future for agriculture that feeds a growing planet while maintaining the livelihoods of farmers is feasible. And industry players, policy makers, and investors can accelerate the path to the future while enabling their own growth.",

            "Signposts are markers based on a companyâs strategy that indicate when it should consider investing or divesting from a market, segment, or product. Signposts can also indicate the right time to scale up investments or when strategic positioning moves can be turned into shaping moves.",
            "For example, investment in gasification to produce biofuels could depend on the development of scalable gasification technology, government incentives or mandates for advanced biofuel feedstocks, demand for advanced feedstock biofuel products, and low-cost supply of cellulosic feedstocks.",
            "Trigger points define the conditions under which an organization is prepared to act and what market conditions would change the strategic direction of the company. In the gasification example, trigger points for investment could include a full-scale gasification plant coming online, a government mandate that a certain percentage of fuel must be derived from cellulosic feedstock, customers making public commitments to fuel 10 percent of their fleet via fuels from gasification, or competitors beginning to acquire cellulosic feedstock aggregators to secure their supply.",
            "Fewer well-defined, high-quality signposts are generally a better aid to decision making than many ill-defined ones, as monitoring too many signposts creates a fog that obscures the most important changes in the landscape. For example, signposts related to energy-transition scenarios could include the percentage of electric vehicle sales or the share of alternative fuels used in aviation. By monitoring these indicators, companies can assess changes in oil demand that could help to define their next moves (Exhibit 3).",
            "In the face of uncertainty, a blanket âwait and seeâ approach can feel comforting but carries risks. Without decisive action, companies could lose entry to control points along the value chain (such as feedstocks, infrastructure, and access to customers) as competitors secure their positions. Companies could also miss a window of opportunity due to long lead times for project delivery. âAct and adjustâ may be the more prudent mantra than âwait and see.â",

            "In this article, we discuss the extent of post-harvest losses in Southeast Asia, the role they play in worsening food insecurity in the region, propose steps stakeholders could take to reduce waste, and highlight various key examples.",
            "A devastating amount of food is lost in the region every year by farmers to retailers. This is because post-harvest losses affect all major crops, including fruit, vegetables, and pulses. However, losses in rice, wheat, and other cereal grainsâwhich account for 70 percent of all calories consumedâare particularly striking.",

The severity of losses varies across different stages after harvesting, so a key factor to reducing post-harvest loss is to adopt a unified approach toward stemming these losses (see sidebar âCrops suffer significant post-harvest losses across the value chainâ).",
            "According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), post-harvest losses account for approximately one-third of the worldâs food production, making it one of the leading causes of food insecurity for millions of families across the world.",
            " In Southeast Asia, close to 17 percent of total food available is lost or wasted. A country like Indonesia loses 20 percent of its harvested crops each year, while the Philippines loses up to 50 percent.",
            "Our in-depth examination of the farm-to-retailer food supply chain reveals that food lossâ âfood lossâ happens at harvest or soon after, while âfood wasteâ happens after the food reaches the retailer or consumerâis a result of inefficiencies, and its hidden costs are often equal to or greater than retailersâ net profit, even the best-performing ones.",
            "The good news is that reducing food loss is immensely achievable. Food manufacturers and retailers, at the center of the food value chain, could cut food loss by 50 to 70 percent and are therefore uniquely positioned to lead efforts in this area. Two-thirds of the food recouped could be redirected to human consumption, while the remaining one-third could be used for alternative products such as bio-based materials or animal feed.",
            "Reducing post-harvest crop losses can have tremendous impact. For instance, reducing these losses in Southeast Asia by 40 percent is equivalent to gaining the food output from 1.8 million hectares of land, which is roughly 22 percent of Malaysiaâs agricultural land.",
            " This potential gain in land can be achieved by approaches and technologiesâboth traditional and more advancedâthat address why losses occur in the first place (see sidebar âDifferent waste-reduction technologies have been successful at different value chain stagesâ).",
            "The long-term adoption of these technologies may depend on a range of external, social, economic, and institutional factors, but here are four fundamental steps that businesses can take:",
            " Collect data on the losses experienced at the relevant stages in the value chain by weighing or counting, as determining the percentage of crops lost at each stage can establish a baseline. This can be validated by conducting further research through field trials or focus groups to understand the root causes and to test hypotheses.",
            "Look for areas within the value chain that have the largest inefficiencies and earmark potential solutions that could address them. And then map these against existing capabilities to see where synergies lie for a higher chance of success. For example, in Vietnam, 5 percent of maize was lost during drying largely due to damage caused by birds, rats, and other animals, and improper drying techniques.",
            " Many solutions today require an ecosystem approach to gain higher value. This involves bringing on board stakeholders from across the entire value chainâfarmers to processors; input players such as fertilizer, crop protection, and seed vendors; and retailers and enablers like telco and logistical partners. Understanding the pain points of different stakeholders and whether the solutions proposed can work for them will go a long way to addressing the post-harvest crop losses.",
            " In Southeast Asia, the food and agriculture industry needs rejuvenating. Technology adoption lags and investing in this area could therefore be particularly impactful. It would likely take a lot of education to convince farmers and those in the food processing sector to accept technology, and there may no way to do this other than to mobilize boots on the ground. Government agencies and technology providers might be best placed to do thisâsignificant effort would be required on their part. If successful though, a younger, savvier workforce could be attracted to this industry.",
            "Early movers in this sector are likely to get ahead as long as their value proposition is closely aligned with improving key stakeholder performance across the supply chain.

        "paragraphs": [
            " is under pressure. Dramatic cost increases for inputs and labor are putting farmersâ profitability at risk. Globally, farmers report that prices for inputs such as fertilizer and crop protection chemicals have risen by 80 to 250 percent over the past few years.",
            " Climate change is also squeezing profits. A warmer climate is resulting in increased weather variability, more frequent acute weather events, longer droughts, and new invasive crops and pests, all of which reduce yields. In the American Southwest, for example, an ongoing megadrought is so severe that the past two decades have been the regionâs driest in at least 1,200 years.",
            "To navigate these challenges and remain economically viable, farmers must find innovative solutions. Automation shows considerable promise for reducing the impact of farming on climate change and helping growers adapt to its financial impact. Autonomous farming solutions exist on a spectrum, requiring varied levels of operator support. This ranges from semi-automated technology widely adopted today (e.g., assisted steering) to fully automated systems (e.g., weeding robots). Next-generation technologies use a combination of sensors, analytics, robotics, and equipment to help farmers make smarter decisions on the field and do more with less. In addition, recent developments in generative AI present future opportunities to automate decision making using vast data sets that already exist. Potential examples include helping farmers develop strategic plans about what inputs (fertilizer, crop protection, and seeds) to apply, at what times and what rates, to best support a farmâs profitability and sustainable practices. Automated technology can deliver significant value to both row- and specialty-crop growers. For instance, fully autonomous use cases across orchards and vineyards can deliver more than $400 per acre per year in value, doubling to quadrupling returns on farmersâ investment in automation.",
            "These are still early days for autonomy. McKinseyâs ",
            " reveals that less than 5 percent of farmers across Asia, Europe, North America, and South America are using this next-generation technology, compared with 21 percent using farm management software.",
            " We have observed two trends that are likely to boost adoption: pressures on farm economics and the push toward more-sustainable farming practices. In this article, we take a deeper look at these trends and how they are positioned to change the future of farm equipment and farm operations.",
            "Farm automation can help address two problems that have plagued farmers for several years: rising chemical costs and labor challenges.",
            "Supply chain disruptions and geopolitical challenges have pushed up the prices of widely used fertilizers (for example, urea, diammonium phosphate, and potash) by more than 15 percent per year over the past five years (Exhibit 1). In a McKinsey survey last year, US farmers ranked input costs as the number-one risk to their profitability, with the price of fertilizers and crop protection chemicals rising the most (Exhibit 2).",
            "Automation can help reduce these costs by enabling farmers to use pesticides and fertilizers more efficiently. For example, automated precision spraying enabled by sensors and field data (both stored and in real time) can sense gaps between crops and adjust the volume and timing of chemical sprayed accordingly, using fewer chemicals. Some herbicide application technologies use computer vision to selectively spray weeds and avoid crops. On large US corn farms, these solutions have been shown to reduce herbicide costs by 80 percent, creating a value of $30 per acre and a payback period of two years.",
            " Similarly, fertilizer application robots enabled with sensors can control the amount of fertilizer that is directly applied onto individual seeds during the planting process. This can save more than 93 million gallons of starter fertilizer annually across US corn farms alone.",
            "Labor is also a persistent pain point for farmers. Farmworkers are at high risk of injuries and have the highest rate of fatal occupational injuries in the United States.",
            " Prolonged exposure to chemicals and sun also adds to the perception of farm work as difficult and dangerous.",
            " In the United Kingdom, for instance, more than 22 million pounds of fruits and vegetables were wasted in 2022 because of a shortage of workers to pick crops.",
            " Such labor shortages and demands from workers to be compensated for adverse work conditions have accelerated an increase in farmworker wages. In the United States, wages rose 4 percent annually between 2015 and January 2022, compared with less than 1 percent annually between 2000 and 2014 (Exhibit 3).",
            "Automation can help ease these challenges in several ways. It can improve working conditions on the farm, lower the operating skills required by workers, and reduce a farmâs labor costs. For example, semiautomated technology such as assisted steering systems guides tractors to reduce overlap between passes, making equipment operation less physically taxing. Fully autonomous equipment takes this a step further. Instead of sitting in a cab doing hazardous activities such as spraying, machine operators can serve as fleet managers who oversee multiple machines. This also enhances worker productivity and reduces labor costs. In a scenario in which automation enables one worker on a US corn farm to manage four machines, the savings amounts to $15 to $20 per acre, which can unlock up to about $1.5 billion in value annually across all US corn farms.",
            " For US specialty crops, for which labor is a larger cost driver, the value potential for growers is even greater. For example, in the same scenario in which one worker manages four machines, automated weeding and mowing alone could generate $30 per acre in labor savings on US vineyards. Automation could also help reduce herbicide costs while maintaining yields due to the ability to complete mechanical weeding more frequently given relaxed labor requirements (savings of $100 per acre).",
            "Unlike input costs, which are an immediate tailwind for adoption, sustainability pressures have yet to be fully realized and are expected to become material in the near future. In a few years, however, action on two frontsâregulators and consumersâcould be an even bigger accelerant for automation technologies.",
            "Around the world, many governments have set ambitious targets for more environmentally sustainable practices (Exhibit 4). The European Green Deal, for example, calls for a transformation of European agriculture by 2030, including a 50 percent reduction in pesticide use, compared with 2020 levels. Additionally, the plan seeks to transition one-quarter of all agricultural land to organic farming to reduce the use of synthetic fertilizers and herbicides. Similarly, Canada wants farmers to use 30 percent less fertilizer by 2030 than they did in 2020. Canadian growers who donât meet the target will risk losing access to $1.1 billion in government aid and grants for the purchase of greener farm equipment.",
            "Automation represents a significant lever for meeting these requirements. By using automated precision-spraying equipment combined with automated weeding or mowing solutions, farmers can dramatically reduce their use of pesticides and fertilizers or potentially eliminate them altogether. Moreover, because automated equipment digitally records whatâs been applied to crops, farmers can seamlessly collect data and keep records on their operations. This makes it easier for farmers to participate in current programs such as organic certification and GLOBALG.A.P. Down the road, it could also help farmers comply with the reporting requirements of programs such as the European Green Deal.",
            "Consumer interest in a more sustainable food system is growing, with motivated shoppers exerting downstream pressure on farmers to change the way they produce food. A 2023 McKinsey US consumer study found that sustainable brands are already seeing market progress, due to an increased interest among consumers. Products making environmental, social, and governance (ESG)ârelated claims averaged 28 percent cumulative growth over the past five years, compared with 20 percent for products that do not make such claims. Products making multiple types of ESG claimsâsuch as environmental sustainability and organic-farming methodsâgrew about twice as fast as products that made only one claim.",
            "Responding to consumer demand, consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) companies have been actively making a range of environment commitments, including how the raw materials and ingredients that go into their products are sourced and grown (Exhibit 5). NestlÃ©, for example, has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, improve the traceability of its raw materials, and reduce chemical use on farms by 2030.",
            " Further consumer adoption of sustainability-oriented products is likely to accelerate companiesâ ESG journeys.",
            "Software solutionsâincluding farm measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) platforms as well as farm management systemsâare already offering avenues for farmers to begin providing consumers with farm-to-fork traceability. This includes the aggregation and storage of data on planting locations, growing time, and the use of fertilizers and crop protection chemicals. Autonomous equipment with cameras and sensors can take this a step further by collecting and transmitting rich, standardized data with minimal effort from farmers. This can help farmers substantiate the sustainable farming practices that CPG companies increasingly want, including reduced chemical applications, more efficient irrigation, and better harvest conditions.",
            "The adoption of automated farm equipment will be influenced by many factors, including technological maturity and performance, macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical dynamics, regulatory decisions, and environmental changes. As they shape their offerings, agriculture companies may want to consider several levers:",
            "If farm economics and sustainability continue to apply pressure on farmers, we anticipate that adoption of automated technology will accelerate dramatically. As more growers realize the triple win that farm automation can representâgreater agricultural productivity and profits, improved farm safety, and advances toward environmental-sustainability goalsâexcitement about these technologies will spread.",

            "But there are significant problems holding back the nationâs untapped potential. If solved, a flourishing agriculture industry could both boost the economy and significantly improve farmer livelihoods and income. By 2030, agriculture could contribute around $600 billion",
            " to Indiaâs GDPâan increase of 50 percent over its contribution in 2020.",
            " But to get there, India must unlock growth and productivity for the sector.",
            "The key to expanding Indiaâs transformation into a farming powerhouse is agricultural technology, or agtech. India lags behind developed farming nations in agtech. Simply put, Indiaâs farmers are competing at a disadvantage: half lack basic farming equipment, three of every four farms are at risk of crop damage from pests and weather, and 50 percent of Indiaâs farmers lack access to traditional financing sources. Those who can get credit often pay inflated interest of 10 to 25 percent above market rates.",
            "In this article, we examine agtechâs potential, how it is already improving outcomes, and what investors are looking for as rural India embraces modern farming. Agtech can be a shot in the arm for Indiaâs farmers, making them more profitable and boosting the contribution of agriculture to Indiaâs economy.",
            "Historically, the farmer was just one of the many stakeholders involved in a market that centered on ",
            "âthe local markets where farmers sell their products at auction. The advent of digital technologies and the evolution of multiple agtechs have put the farmer right at the heart of the entire ecosystem. Solutions have begun to be more farmer-centric: each part of the value chain that is digitizing, be it finance, inputs (products needed to grow crops such as seeds, agrochemicals, and fertilizers), or advisoryâare directly targeting the farmer.",
            "Between 2013 and 2020, the agtech landscape in India grew from less than 50 start-ups to more than 1,000, fueled by increased farmer awareness, rising internet penetration in rural India, and the need for greater efficiency in the agriculture sector.",
            " Moreover, Indiaâs regulatory environment is gradually evolving to facilitate the growth of digital technologies in agriculture.",
            "Agtech in India continues to ramp upâfrom core companies in the value chain using digital technologies like âsuper appsâ to innovations by start-ups, or âagrifintechs,â and large technology companies.",
            "Fully nurtured, the agtech ecosystem has the potential to propel Indian farmersâ incomes to grow by 25 to 35 percent.",
            "Existing agriculture incumbents use digital technologies to either go direct to the farmer or to expand products and services across adjacencies. Suppliers are becoming buyers, advisers are adding financeâany combination is possible and happening:",
            "Fully nurtured, the agtech ecosystem has the potential to propel Indian farmersâ incomes to grow by 25 to 35 percent ,   and add  $95 billion to the Indian economy, through reduction of input costs, enhanced productivity and price realization, cheaper credit, and alternative incomes (Exhibit 1).",
            "Indiaâs government has also taken several policy steps and conducted pilots to foster technology and innovation in the agricultural sector:",
            "These initiatives are building an agtech ecosystem in the country, supporting farmers in areas where they need the most help.",
            "With government initiatives and the openness of farmers to tech adoption, agtechs are poised to engage with Indiaâs farmers, but to be successful, they will need stable sources of funding and a vibrant, supportive ecosystem.",
            "Agriculture technology in India has flourished with the growing attention from venture capital (VC) in recent years. Accel and Sequoia Capital invested in companies such as Samunnati, Ninjacart, DeHaat, and Bijak.",
            " During the past four years, agtechs in India have raised roughly $1.6 billion. VC firms invested more than $1.2 billion in 2022 alone through 114 deals, a 50 percent increase from 2021 and triple the investment made in 2020. The average deal size is growing, indicating that start-ups are maturing in this space despite an economic slowdown during the past two years (Exhibit 2).",
            "Of nine agtech categories, 90 percent of all VC funding was directed at five categories in 2022 (Exhibit 3):",
            "Unlike the rest of the world, where agricultural investment has centered on innovative foodsâthink Impossible Burgers or other plant-based foodsâinvestment in India has centered on the basics: financing and technology to improve agriculture and farm practices   and to avoid climate risks (such as droughts, pests, and flooding).",
            "As a result, investors approach India with a different view. Our interviews with VC firms suggest that they focus on five factors when making decisions about new technologies: the size of the market, the breadth of offerings, traction with customers, an ability to scale, and the X factor   (intangibles such as the learning curve it takes to use the new technologies efficiently).",
            "Investors in Indian agtech are, or should be, asking some basic questions, including the following.",
            " Unlike e-commerce, agtechs get low transaction volumes for farmers but pay high acquisition costs, such as to get a farmer to install an app and try a product. This is complicated by the ceaseless efforts of multiple agtechs and incumbents to enter the space, lowering costs, and the farmers themselves being willing to experiment with multiple apps in the quest for most value.",
            "To overcome this challenge, start-ups such as Gramophone, Samunnati, DeHaat, and more  are offering more touchpoints and broadening their product portfolios to provide services across the value chain, from inputs and financing to advisory. Even platforms that start out with a single use case are expanding into adjacent parts of the value chain.",
            " In rural India, both physical and digital infrastructure are important. Although 75 to 80 percent of farmer households have access to a smartphone,",
            " most still prefer to have physical touchpoints for digital support such as tutorials or help with app installation. Agtechs such as Agrostar and DeHaat have field teams to make on-ground visits and to drive campaigns for greater penetration of their apps.",
            "One way to support a customer: the ITC e-Choupal ecosystem has managed to bridge the gap in rural digital infrastructure through a network of central sanchalaks (overseers), who act as physical touchpoints for the ecosystem and on whom farmers continue to rely.",
            "In-person contact with the farmer can happen in multiple ways. Field representatives are one option. Other examples include a fertilizer supplierâs presence in Indiaâs local micromarkets or rural bank branches for agrifintechs.",
            " The right monetization model is crucial. Some firms are trying to monetize advisory services, but most farmersânot just Indian farmersâare reluctant to pay for advice. In general, advice is a gateway to business, not a business itself.",
            " Agtechs that rely less on investments in assets can scale up across geographies quickly. For example, Agribazaar had reached $2,250 million of gross merchandise value in fiscal year 2021,",
            " with a fixed-asset base of around $2.5 million.",
            " It did so by shifting the responsibility of storage, quality checks, and transport to buyers and sellers on the platform for the majority of transactions.",
            "Agtechs that require investments in physical infrastructure or assets typically try to keep their models dependent on local entrepreneurs who make the investments in equipment and facilities. For example, DeHaat and Agrostar use village entrepreneurs to provide last-mile service and deliveries within villages, enabling them to aggregate demand and deliver larger volumes.",
            "The investors and agtechs that navigate Indiaâs unique hurdles may see boundless potential. The next three to five years will be critical for incumbents and new players.",
            "It likely wonât become a winner-takes-all market. A few major players, especially those with strong supply chain linkages to the farm, could emerge as dominant players in this space. These companies could support a host of smaller, niche players that will in turn leverage the end-to-end platforms for growth.",
            "Collaboration will be crucial. While agtechs might facilitate better decision making and replace manual farming practices like spraying, reducing dependence on retailers and ",
            ", incumbents remain important in the new ecosystem for R&D and the supply of chemicals and fertilizers.",
            "There are successful platforms already emerging that offer farmers an umbrella of products and services to address multiple, critical pain points. These one-stop shop agri-ecosystems are also creating a physical backbone/supply chainâwhich makes it easier for incumbents and start-ups to access the fragmented farmer base.",
            "Agtechs have a unique opportunity to become ideal partners for companies seeking market access. In this scenario, existing agriculture companies are creating value for the farmer by having more efficient and cost-effective access to the farmer versus traditional manpower-intensive setups. Itâs a system that builds: the more agtechs know the farmer, the better products they can develop.",
            "Indiaâs farms have been putting food on the table for India and the world for decades. Digital technologies could enhance production at every step, from high-quality agriculture inputs to world-class agriculture outputs. This could help create sustainable growth for the Indian farmer, boost economic fortunes in rural areas in a flourishing ecosystem, and benefit the entire economy.",

        "paragraphs": [
            " executive vice president for agriculture and industrial biosolutions at Novozymes, which develops enzymes and microbes to improve animal health and feed efficiency. Harry Bowcott, a McKinsey senior partner and leader of the firmâs Sustainability Practice in the United Kingdom and Ireland, talked with Tina about biotechnologyâs potential in making animal production more sustainable and the need for collaboration, both along the value chain and among sectors, to successfully transition to a net-zero economy.",
            "Tina, how do you see the role of biotech in animal production?",
            " Biotech is very important. It can mean many different things, but Iâm most interested in âwhiteâ biotechnologyâwhich adds the enzymes, microbes, and other living cells to animal feed or is used to clean water in aquacultureâbecause it can support sustainable animal production in many ways. For example, biotech is already leading to higher yields, so that less feed is necessary to get the same output; it might also reduce the use of antibiotics.",
            "What role can sustainable animal production play in the global transition to a net-zero economy?",
            " There is a lot of talk today about how alternative proteins will nourish the ever-growing world population. Alternative proteins will play an important role, alongside animal production, but they will not replace it. Market trends suggest that animal production will grow for many years because it is an integral part of feeding the increasing population, so our focus should be making animal production as sustainable as possible. Novozymes has a portfolio of solutions not only for animal production but also for alternative proteins, because we see both as a part of a sustainable future of food production.",
            " Should this interface between animal production and alternative proteins be viewed as a competition among companies or an opportunity to collaborate?",
            " I donât think competition is the answer. While alternative proteins and animal production both have a role to play in sustainable food systems, they are different tools in the toolbox, and the industry should see them as coexisting. It is far more important for the industry to cooperate to influence stakeholders, including the broader population, to move in a more sustainable direction. I firmly believe in partnerships and coalitions, and agriculture is an area where we can collaborate more closely to achieve a more sustainable future.",
            "What are some exciting innovations that could come to the market soon?",
            " I can tell you about three specific examples of innovative products, and then Iâd like to highlight an area where I see a need for more innovation.",
            "The first example is a product developed by Novozymes that enables more sustainable animal production by reducing the use of antibiotics in poultry farms. We are commercializing this product with the Dutch biotech company DSM. The second innovation is a DSM product that reduces methane emissions from ruminants. This product is still in its infancy, but it is in an area where I see sustainability and innovation going hand in hand. A third product, also developed by Novozymes, supports the use of alternative and local feeds so that you get more benefit from your feed, which can increase sustainability in the global supply chain.",
            "Finally, I believe more sustainability technology and innovation are needed at the farm level; we need to think of the farmâs entire carbon account, how we can measure it, and how technology can help. Such information will lead to better financing. We also need to transition to AI technologies to learn how they can optimize operations to benefit the climate and the individual farmer. Right now, with increased inflation and high raw-material prices, farmers are struggling, but innovation and technologies can support them. Itâs important that innovative solutions not only help to optimize farm sustainability but also to help farmers with their bottom line. Data, technology, and finances form a triangle; they need to go hand in hand to create that sustainability revolution.",
            " Thatâs the challengeâtrying to manage all these things together. You touched on the need for the farmer to meet the bottom line, but who will pay for such innovations?",
            "It may sound expensive, but it doesnât need to be. Sustainability is a shared responsibility, and consumers will have to pay more for sustainable products. Farmers cannot absorb all the costs.",
            " So much of the change we need to bring about seems to include this notion of collaborating differently, whether in the public or private sector or in ecosystems within the private sector. But what does collaboration really mean? How can we make it work?",
            " I have a lot of experience in collaboration. It sounds nice but can be very difficult. To collaborate successfully, itâs important to have an aligned strategy or a desire for a common future. You need to have that left, right, and center as you progress in the partnership. It is also important to keep the end goal in mind. And for a partnership to deliver more than the sum of its parts, you have to give now and then. The joy of partnerships is having skills, business models, and geographical elements that complement one another. You need to be able to see that working together will lead to synergies.",
            " A recent impressive example of collaboration involved a postal logistics company. A segment of its customer base was prepared to pay a green premium for net-zero parcel delivery, so the company offered to commit its net-zero parcel volume to a particular shipper, which could borrow against that future volume to retrofit its vehicles. Suddenly, four playersâa postal logistics player, a shipper, a bank, and an ammonia fuel cell producerâwere working together along a value chain in a completely different way to accelerate a customer objective.",
            "Thatâs a perfect example of how collaboration can work. For sustainable animal production, you need the farmer, the financing, and the animal health and nutrition providers working together to secure a sustainable future. We are all in this together, so I encourage consulting with peers in other sectors about the collaborative ecosystems they are creating as we transition toward a net-zero global economy.",

Executives of dairy companies have had to navigate inflation, supply chain challenges, labor shortages, and climate change, not to mention changing regulations and political conflict. At the same time, the dairy industry has been a site of innovation, with the entrance of new products to the market, shifting consumer awareness, and increasing competition.",
            "Amid these challenges, dairy executives have had to prioritize where to direct their companiesâ resources and attention. The choice hasnât been easy: a number of pressing concerns have required strategic decisions and thoughtful responses.",
            "In the third quarter of 2022, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) and McKinsey jointly surveyed more than 100 executives and leaders of companies in the dairy industry.",
            " After the survey, we augmented our research with about 50 interviews of industry leaders in the fourth quarter of 2022.",
            " Participating companies come from around the world and represent a range of organization types and sizes, including public and private companies; cooperatives, dairy processors, producers, packagers, and retailers; and companies with last-year revenues ranging from $100 million to more than $30 billion.",
            "To gain insights into the strategic priorities of dairy industry leaders in todayâs world, McKinsey conducted its ",
            "Â as well as almost 50 interviews with industry leaders (see sidebar, âAbout the researchâ). In this article, we examine the results, exploring dairy executivesâ top strategic priorities of growth, resilience, and sustainability. Despite current geopolitical and economic volatility, we heard great excitement and optimism for the future of dairy in North America.",
            "Among a range of options, a few areas stood out as key priorities for leaders in dairy: growth, resilience, and sustainability (exhibit). In terms of growth, leaders are considering expanding into new categories, markets, and geographies and thinking about the roles that company purpose and critical stakeholders play. In terms of resilience, supply chain and cost-related challenges are top of mind. Last, sustainability concerns are gaining ground.",
            "Three of the four most cited strategic priorities relate to supporting company growth, highlighting executivesâ focus on the topic.",
            "Of the executives we surveyed, 53 percent cited âsetting and strengthening a corporate purpose for stakeholdersâ as a top three strategic priority for their company. A high level of interest in corporate purpose makes sense: purpose provides value for consumers and employees and could lead to better company performance. Research has linked companies that have a clear purpose with greater success in company growth, global expansion, number of product launches, and transformations, compared with companies lacking a clear purpose.",
            " Beyond benefits at the corporate level, company purpose also benefits employee stakeholders. When employees can live their purpose at work, they are not only more productive, healthy, and resilient but also more likely to stay at the company and contribute to its success.",
            "In addition to perceiving the value of company purpose, dairy executives have also been prioritizing stakeholder relationships in the broadest sense. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way dairy stakeholders interact across the value chain, requiring executives to step up. Some executives are taking new actions to care for their employees, from making sure employeesâ voices are heard to providing employee housing and transportation. Also, almost 70 percent of respondents are now collaborating in some way with other stakeholders, from farmers and suppliers to research institutions. Companies that do not typically work together are also collaborating. For example, dairy exporters, a trade association, ports, and shipping lines came together in 2022 to discuss shipping challenges facing the industry, breaking down historical barriers to address pressing supply chain issues.",
            "With an âall in it togetherâ mentality, industry stakeholders broke down historical barriers to reach a solution to our supply chain challenges. This would never have happened before the pandemic.",
            "Of the executives we surveyed, 45 percent cited âentering new categories, markets, and geographiesâ as a top three strategic priority for their company. Despite current challenges, including declining fluid-milk consumption, 45 percent of executives are prioritizing new growth opportunities, and most executives we spoke to expressed optimism about the future of dairy. Executives are most excited about opportunities for the US dairy industry, given possible supply constraints in the European Union and Oceania and expectations that dairy consumption in AsiaâPacific will grow about 7 percent annually over the next five years.",
            " Amid these conditions, US dairy is well positioned to increase supply and help satisfy demand for dairy abroad.",
            "This strategic focus on growth has been felt in dairy markets at home and around the world. From 2021 to 2022, the market for US dairy grew 3 percent overall (based on retail value), with yogurt and sour-milk products growing by 6 percent and drinking-milk products growing by 1 percent. Globally, growth was 4 percent overall, 2 percent for yogurt and sour-milk products, and 5 percent for drinking-milk products.",
            " Accordingly, executives are investing in expanding capacity to meet this market demand: more than 20 industry stakeholders recently announced capital investments in the United States and Europe.",
            "Despite the slowdown in the economy, dairy consumption has not gone down. We still have consumer loyalty. We are a staple; and on top of that, there are a lot of different, exciting forms of dairy products coming down the pipeline.",
            "Of the executives we surveyed, 44 percent cited âtalent and capability developmentâ as a top three strategic priority for their company. Companies have found hiring and retaining talent difficult, with about 70 percent of executives in our 2022 survey noting concerns with labor.",
            "This trend is not new: in our 2021 survey, a similar percentage of executives noted that labor shortages were a top three concern during the prior 12 months.",
            "Executives shared that these challenges are pushing them to rethink the workplace, consider what is most important to employees, and invest in people. Companies have been expanding the benefits they offer, including flexible scheduling, shorter workdays, additional pay and vacation, and even company-provided apartments and transportation. It will be critical for companies to work with employees to improve hiring and retention and reduce the employerâemployee mismatch in what they consider to be important. Clear alignment between employee needs and employer offerings may help the dairy industry tackle these labor challenges.",
            "We have great customers and a great product but not enough people to make it.",
            "In addition to growth, a complex geopolitical climate and a volatile economic situation have made dairy executives prioritize resilience-building measures.",
            "Half of the executives we surveyed cited âcost reduction and efficiency initiativesâ as a top three strategic priority for their company. Input costs for dairy processors have risen remarkably over the past year. In September 2022, all milk prices were 33 percent higher than the year prior, compared with just a 2 percent increase from 2020 to 2021.",
            " This is in part due to dramatic increases in energy costs as well as costlier labor, with total compensation costs for civilian workers rising 5 percent from September 2021 to September 2022.",
            " Given the increasing cost of inputs, dairy processors are trying to balance three actions: reducing costs, increasing their prices, and, ultimately, squeezing their margins. About 75 percent of interviewed executives are concerned about the effects of inflation and have already taken actions to address supply-side challenges and a consumer side that has been hit hard by inflation.",

            "Of the executives we surveyed, 39 percent cited âincreasing supply chain resilienceâ as a top three strategic priority for their company. It is no surprise that supply chain concerns are top of mind for executives, a result that was consistent across both our survey and our supplementary interviews: about 65 percent of interviewees noted the supply chain as a challenge for their company. Supply chain problems have ranged from difficulty accessing materials to problems with shippingâresulting in delayed capital expenditure projectsâinability to get certain ingredients, and overall inconsistency and unpredictability, among other consequences. In light of these challenges, executives have prioritized building supply chains that are more resilient.",

            "In addition to growth and resilience, executives highlighted sustainability as their third most important strategic priority, which aligns with the dairy industryâs commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050.",
            "Of the executives we surveyed, 37 percent cited âtransforming the business to become more environmentally sustainableâ as a top three strategic priority for their company. The sizable minority of executives who rated sustainability transformations as a top priority exist in a broader pool of support for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) values. Out of our survey sample, 75 percent of executives have a sustainability strategy or an ESG strategy (or both). Seventy-two percent have a board or leadership that actively oversees their sustainability programs, and 67 percent have allocated funds to these programs. These are important steps in promoting follow-through and impact. They also show progress: only 57 percent of companies in last yearâs dairy executive survey said they were investing resources to align their business with their sustainability goals.",

Customers are one of the biggest drivers of sustainable practices among dairy processors: 70 percent of processors with sustainability or ESG strategies cited customer requirements as a top three motivator. These companies have also highlighted working closely with customers to meet their requirements.",
            "Our sustainability and ESG strategy largely integrates the goals of customers.",
            "Investor pressures and regulatory requirements are less important than customer demand, but they still drive sustainability for processors, with 28 percent and 23 percent of companies citing these as top three motivators, respectively. Both investor pressures and regulatory requirements have the potential to change the competitive landscape when it comes to sustainability. For example, if new regulation makes certain environmental changes mandatory for all companies, leaders in sustainability may need to find novel approaches to stand out from the crowd. This can simultaneously lead to collaborative sustainability improvements across the dairy industry and new opportunities for companies to compete on ESG, ultimately ensuring lasting environmental change.",

        "description": "Five insights from McKinsey’s 2022 US Dairy Consumer Survey reveal how dairy consumption is changing.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " in the American diet: 84 percent of US consumers eat and drink dairy or dairy alternatives, and only 16 percent donât consume either product. As new plant-based dairy alternatives enter the market and prices fluctuate, these consumer groups are demonstrating shifts in their consumption of dairy and alternatives, underpinned by unique demographic factors and values.",
            "To keep the pulse of dairy consumption in the United States, McKinsey conducted its fifth annual survey of US consumers of dairy and dairy alternatives to analyze how their habits and attitudes have changed over time. Based on responses from 1,217 consumers surveyed in August 2022, our analysis revealed five key findings:",
            "In this article, we dive deep into the results of our survey to explore these five key findings and the takeaways businesses can use as these trends affect the buying and consumption of dairy and dairy alternatives. By staying aware of shifting consumer interests, US dairy players can better understand the forces driving changes across the market and adjust their strategies accordingly.",
            "This yearâs annual dairy survey provided insight into trends among US dairy and dairy alternative consumers, as well as the demographic factors underpinning them. Overall, dairy maintains a strong foothold: our survey found that almost all customers consume dairy products, with only a very small minority consuming plant-based alternatives exclusively (Exhibit 1). The dairy-only consumer group is primarily composed of meat eaters and tends to be older. Plant-only consumers are often younger and vegan or vegetarian. And more-affluent consumersâthose with a household income of $100,000 or moreâtend to consume both plant-based and dairy products.",
            "While dairy products still maintain significant market share, plant-based alternatives have gained traction in recent years. More than one-third of consumers bought plant-based alternatives for the first time after 2020. In fact, the US market for plant-based dairy grew by 15 percent from 2019 to 2020, by 6 percent from 2020 to 2021, and by 11 percent from 2021 to 2022.",
            " There is evidence of the continued shift toward plant-based alternatives: approximately 45 percent of people who consume plant-based products plan to increase such consumption in the next three years.",
            "Although plant-based consumption is on the rise, there are ebbs and flows within its subcategories. For instance, in plant-based beverages, soy milk has lost market share to other alternatives such as almond milk and oat milk.",
            " And in contrast to overall growth in the plant-based market, there have been recent pockets of decline as consumers appear to leave categoriesâsuch as in the second quarter of 2022, which saw a decline in plant-based creamers, yogurt, cheese, and ice cream.",
            "What does this mean for dairy? Overall, loyalty appears mixed: out of consumers who have tried plant-based alternatives, 49 percent have stopped consuming dairy or consume less than they used to, whereas only about 45 percent plan to continue their usual dairy consumption (Exhibit 2). Even so, our survey found that the majority of consumers in the United States only consume dairy, not alternatives, indicating dairyâs strong market hold across the consumer landscape. As of 2022, US retail volume market share for plant-based beverage alternatives was relatively small at 12 percent, and the share for cheese and yogurt alternatives was only 2 percent.",
            " Furthermore, over the next three years, approximately 90 percent of people have no plans to reduce their dairy product consumption.",
            "Consumers note inflated prices across both dairy products and plant-based alternatives, but more consumers noted higher prices in dairy. For example, 82 percent of consumers noticed higher prices for dairy milk, whereas only 65 percent noticed higher prices for oat milk and 62 percent for other plant-based beverages. However, consumer perception may not correspond exactly with real price increases because many variables can influence perception. For instance, the average dairy-only consumer has lower household income and may be more aware of price fluctuations. Dairy consumers also ranked price above all other factors as the most important consideration in deciding their last dairy purchaseâa pattern that was not evident for consumers of plant-based alternatives.",
            "Even though consumers are more motivated by price when buying dairy products and notice inflation in dairy more than in alternatives, their commitment to dairy products in the face of inflation appears stronger. When asked about their behavior in the past month after noticing price increases, 56 percent of consumers reported that they have continued buying the same amount of dairy milk and are not switching products, brands, or product sizes. On the other hand, only 38 percent of soy milk consumers and 32 percent of consumers of other plant-based beverages said the same. Drivers of this loyalty may vary, but, regardless, consumers of dairy products seem less likely to alter their dairy purchases even in an inflationary environment. These results are consistent with the relatively inelastic nature of dairy products.",
            "Consumption of dairy and plant-based alternatives is driven by taste preferences and perceived health benefits. For dairy consumers, taste was far and away the most important reason given for consuming milk (70 percent), followed by health reasons (29 percent) (Exhibit 3). Plant-based dairy consumers are also driven by taste and health, but they are mostly motivated by health reasons (42 percent), closely followed by product taste (36 percent).",
            "These differing motivations for consumption can be linked to demographic factors. Consumers who incorporate alternatives into their diet (exclusively or in addition to traditional dairy) often self-identify as being committed to personal-health topics. According to our survey, 75 percent of plant-based consumers believe it is very important to eat healthy, and 63 percent claim to try to lead very healthy lifestyles, compared with 46 percent and 35 percent of dairy-only consumers, respectively. McKinsey research on the future of food corroborates these results,",
            " likewise finding that the main reason why consumers of plant-based alternatives select the products is their personal health, followed by their taste preferences.",
            "As ESG values gain sway across the United States, they are influencing consumer behavior; however, concern for ESG characteristics is not evenly distributed across consumers. Those who exclusively consume plant-based products are four times more likely to report prioritizing ESG characteristics in purchasing decisions than dairy-only consumers. Younger consumers also appear to care more. Fifty-three percent of millennials consider reducing their impact on the environment to be an important or extremely important goal in making choices about what to eat, compared with 44 percent of baby boomers. Younger consumers also tend to make their beliefs known on social media, allowing their opinions to be heard and to influence others.",
            "Accordingly, leaders in the dairy sector are receptive to consumer pressures and are making commitments to invest in sustainability. Forty-seven percent of processors with a sustainability or ESG strategy report consumer demands as a top motivation for their company to pursue its strategy, with two-thirds of companies investing corresponding funds for implementation. These motivations outweigh both investor demands and regulatory pressure.",
            " Consumers, then, appear well positioned to help improve sustainability in the US dairy industry.",
            "Just as concern for ESG attributes varies across consumers, willingness to pay for them also varies. While 13 percent of all consumers are willing to pay for ESG attributes, one-fourth of plant-based dairy consumers (exclusively or in combination with dairy products) are willing to pay at least 10 percent more for products that emit fewer greenhouse gases and do not harm animals (Exhibit 4). These findings are promising for the planet and likely foreshadow the important role sustainability will play in consumer decisions moving forward.",
            "As the US dairy market moves forward, companies have several trends to keep in mind. For example, while plant-based alternatives to dairy have gained momentum since 2019 and are expected to continue growing in share, dairy itself has also enjoyed positive momentum. In addition, the data suggests that one-third of all consumers in 2022 care about environmental sustainability, a trend that processors are noticing and an indication that the US dairy industry should consider prioritizing its environmental impact in the years to come.",
            "As they think about consumers in 2023, dairy and plant-based-alternative companies can consider several actions and key areas to focus on when making strategic decisions:",
            "As markets and the economy shift, consumption of dairy and alternatives will shift in tandem. By being mindful of trends, companies in the US dairy and alternatives market can more successfully navigate decision making and take steps to ensure that consumer needs for taste, pricing, nutrition, and sustainability are being met or exceeded.",

        "paragraphs": [
            " generate an estimated 32 percent of global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture.",
            " They are also one of the populations most at risk from climate change. Our analysis shows that in three countriesâIndia, Ethiopia, and Mexicoânearly 80 percent of all smallholder farmers could be affected by at least one climate hazard by 2050 (Exhibit 1). Moreover, climate change will affect land suitability for crop production. For example, by 2050, India could lose 450,000 square kilometers of land currently suitable for rainfed rice cultivation (Exhibit 2).",
            "Stakeholders have focused on climate-smart agriculture for the past two decades. Nonetheless, there is no clear road map for the types of mitigation and adaptation measures smallholder farmers can adopt and how to prioritize investments and efforts to support those measures. In this article, we try to fill this gap. Our work is informed by a geospatial analysis of climate risk in key smallholder markets; an extensive review of current technologies and tools that smallholder farmers can deploy to adapt to and mitigate climate change; and a prioritization of those measures based on agroecological and farming systems in different countries.",
            "Identifying adaptation and mitigation measures that the worldâs 510 million smallholder farmers can adopt is critical to the protection and support of their livelihoods in the face of climate-related hazards.",
            " They are also key to global food security. Smallholder farms produce a third of the worldâs food, and global food demand is expected to increase by 60 percent by 2050.",
            " Meanwhile, climate change has already led to a 21 percent loss of agricultural productivity globally since 1961.",
            " In a world where temperatures could rise another 2Â°C by 2050, there could be large reductions in crop yields if no countermeasures are taken. For example, in Africa, pest-driven losses are expected to increase by 50 percent (compared to the baseline) for staple crops such as maize, rice, and wheat.",
            "These measures are also important for countries with large smallholder populations and those that are making low-carbon pathway commitments, given that they will likely need to help farmers transition to less carbon-intensive agriculture. For example, Kenya has announced a nationally determined contribution (NDC) of reducing 32 percent of emissions by 2030, relative to the baseline. Kenyaâs agricultural sector is the countryâs largest source (58.6 percent) of total emissions.",
            " So reaching its carbon reduction goals will require the participation of its 4.5 million smallholder farmers (about 80 percent of all farmers) and 600,000 pastoralists.",
            "We identified more than 30 measures smallholder farmers can adopt to help adapt to and mitigate climate change. We also noted several approaches that governments, development partners, and the private sector could pursue to help scale those measures. We found that implementing a prioritized set of three measures at scale in each country could mitigate 45 percent of smallholder farmerâdriven carbon emissions. For adaptation, almost every smallholder farmer can adopt at least one on-farm adaptation measure. But about 75 percent can adopt at least threeâand the more measures they adopt, the more likely that greater climate resilience could be achieved.",
            "We identified more than 30 measures smallholder farmers can adopt to help adapt to and mitigate climate change.",
            "Adoption of adaptation and mitigation measures among smallholder farmers is complex. Smallholder farms are fragmented and often have limited access to inputs, new agricultural technologies, and financing. However, as previously mentioned, we identified more than 30 measures smallholder farmers can pursue for adaptation and mitigation. We divide these measures into five categories: animal production practices, rice-based measures, other crop-based measures, land-use change and intensification, and postharvest and processing loss (Table 1). We separate rice measures from other crops because emissions from rice production are anywhere from five to 30 times higher per hectare than those from other crops.",
            "  we looked at adaptation and mitigation levers that smallholder farmers could adopt.",
            "This research involved geospatial and land suitability analytics from McKinseyâs ACRE team (our agriculture advanced-analytics center) and geospatial climate hazard analysis from our Climate Analytics team.",
            "Adaptation addresses the impact of climate change. It refers either to actions taken to reduce vulnerability to the current and future effects of climate change or to taking advantage of opportunities created by climate change. These actions include switching to other crops better suited to climate-related land changes, expanding the use of drought-tolerant crop varieties, and using dry direct-seeding technology for rice.",
            "Mitigation measures focus on the causes of climate change. They are actions taken to reduce and curb the increase of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. Mitigation is achieved either by reducing the sources of these gases or by enhancing the storage of themâfor example, by increasing the size of forests. Some measures include reducing the overapplication of nitrogen fertilizers (especially in China and India), scaling rotational grazing and rangeland restoration, or optimizing animal feed composition to reduce methane produced from enteric fermentation.",
            "We followed a three-step process to determine priority measures that smallholder farmers could adopt:",
            "Of these measures, some are limited to climate adaptation, such as eco-engineering reefs to protect coastlines from flooding and the introduction of pest-tolerant crop varieties. Others are exclusively mitigation measures, such as GHG-focused livestock breed selection and scaling solar-powered irrigation. But many measures have both adaptation and mitigation benefits. For example, introducing irrigation to increase productivity has an indirect mitigation effect, allowing farmers to grow more crops on less land and therefore reducing the amount of land needed for agriculture. But irrigation also has an adaptation benefit by allowing farmers to continue to grow certain crops despite climate changeârelated increases in water stress and drought. (See sidebar, âAbout the research,â for an explanation of adaptation and mitigation and the methodology under which these measures were derived and prioritized; see the technical appendix for the case studies on which each measure is based.) While we focus on carbon emissions and climate adaptation in this article, it is important to note that these measures also have important nature-related benefits. These include reducing land-use change, decreasing nutrient runoff into waterways by moderating fertilizer application, and adopting integrated pest management practices.",
            "Each measure is based on a proven trial in a smallholder farming environment. For example, one measure related to animal production practices focuses on improving livestock breeding systems for increased productivity and reduced GHG emissions. The approach was used in Malawi and Uganda for a community-based goat-breeding program with 269 farmers. In the program, goats reached a higher average weight (from 16 kilograms to 19 kilograms with the improved breeding) and survival rates (from 72 percent to 91 percent); emissions were also reduced.",
            "As another example, in rice production, straw management can be used to maintain and enhance soil fertility and carbon storage. One case from Vietnam showed that the direct incorporation of rice residues into soils after harvest led to increased soil organic carbon by about three metric tons per hectare. The approach also significantly reduced the amount of chemical fertilizer required to achieve the same yields by returning nutrients to the soil.",
            " For other crops, greater use of a combination of six tillage, residue management, and intercropping practices in legumeâriceâwheat cropping systems in India resulted in the lowest emissions. The practices led to 823 to 3,301 kilograms of CO",
            "-equivalent sequestered per hectare per year compared with 4,113 to 7,917 emitted per hectare per year in typical farming practices, as well as a 29 percent decrease in water usage.",
            "The choice of measures to invest in depends on multiple factors, including a countryâs farming system; farmersâ access to markets, which is an indicator of their ability to access other actors such as sales agents for seed companies that sell new drought-resistant seed varieties; cost of adoption; and capabilities required. Taking these factors into account, we prioritized measures using geospatial analysis in three countries: India, Ethiopia, and Mexico. Together, they are home to more than 40 percent of the global smallholder farmer population and generate about one metric gigaton of GHG emissions from agriculture.",
            " The results highlight not only areas of commonality across smallholder systems but also the importance of a differentiated approach by country and subnational region.",
            "Priorities for adaptation differ by country. These differences are mainly driven by varied exposure to climate change hazards and by the farming systems used in the exposed areas (Table 2). For example, using drought-tolerant seed varieties is much more applicable in drought-prone India or Mexico than in Ethiopia. This is because pastoral livestock systems dominate the drought-prone regions of Ethiopia rather than crop production. Moreover, as shown in Exhibit 1, more farmers in India (95 percent of the total) are exposed to at least one risk, and most are exposed to multiple risks, which requires the adoption of multiple adaptation measures. In Ethiopia, on the other hand, 37 percent of farmers are exposed to at least one risk, and few face multiple risks. Nonetheless, resilience is likely to increase for any farmer who adopts multiple measures. Our analysis shows that about 75 percent of smallholder farmers in these three countries could adopt the three highest-priority measures.",
            "From a technical point of view, the breadth of application of all the measures combined would allow the vast majority (90 percent) of farmers in the three countries to adopt at least one mitigation measure. However, the applicability of measures varies across and within countries, driven by different farming systems and practices that lead to different emission mixes (Exhibit 3). For example, fertilizer application rates are more than five times higher in India than in Ethiopia, which means that soil- and fertilizer-related mitigation measures are much more applicable in India.",
            "When layering on feasibility criteria, the top ten mitigation measures highlight important differences by country (Exhibit 4 and Table 3). In India, given its large crop production (and rice production, in particular), rice- and crop-based measures account for nine of the ten priority measures. About 50 percent of smallholder farmerâdriven agriculture emissions in India could be mitigated by scaling agroforestry and transitioning to more sustainable rice production practices on smallholder farms. Agroforestry alone represents the largest opportunity, with a mitigation opportunity seven times that of the next most impactful measure of incorporating rice straw into soils.",
            " This is consistent with the launch of Indiaâs National Agroforestry Policy in 2014. India is the first nation to introduce such a plan to mitigate climate change and increase the resilience of smallholder farmers.",
            "In Ethiopia and Mexico, where cattle production systems are more common, livestock-related measures dominate and could collectively mitigate up to 25 percent and 35 percent of emissions, respectively. In Mexico, 60 percent of land is considered arid or semiarid, with a substantial area dedicated to the range farming of livestock. As a result, one of the largest mitigation opportunities",
            " lies in regenerative rangeland management. In Ethiopia, the livestock sector is responsible for 60 percent of agricultural emissions.",
            " Thus, Ethiopiaâs emission-reduction potential is mostly associated with livestock-based measures (eight of the top ten), with rangeland management, improved timing of livestock sales, increased adoption of veterinary services, and feed-based measures making up a significant proportion of the opportunity.",
            "In aggregate, these countries could achieve about 455 metric megatons of CO",
            "-equivalent emissions savingsâcollectively about 45 percent of the total smallholder farmerâdriven agriculture emissions from India, Ethiopia, and Mexicoâby implementing only the top three prioritized levers across smallholder farms in a comprehensive and widespread manner.",
            "These countries could achieve about 455 metric megatons of CO2-equivalent emissions savings â¦ by implementing only three levers.",
            "Governments, financiers, development organizations, and private-sector players have a key role to play in supporting the global smallholder-farming communityâs shift to more sustainable practices. Our analysis highlights two important considerations for this support.",
            "First, as described above, it is important to prioritize which measures to focus on at a subnational level given the heterogeneity of smallholder farmer production systems, the range of impact, and the feasibility of adoption. This prioritization exercise could enable the identification of clusters of smallholder farms in which multiple measures are feasible for adoption and piloting could begin.",
            "On this point, concerns such as market access are critical. For example, in India, almost all farmer types are within four hours of a market by road. By comparison, in Ethiopia, as few as 10 percent of farmers have market access in some areas because of greater population dispersion and less-developed infrastructure. This low market access suggests a potentially higher cost per farmer to implement measures at scale.",
            "Second, driving adoption of these measures will require solutions at the farm and agriculture-system levels. Not only will farmers have to consider changing on-farm practices, but national agriculture research systems will also have to reflect on how to develop and commercialize new technologies, such as drought-tolerant seeds. Additionally, stakeholders will have to consider investments such as improved infrastructure to build resilience in the face of climate volatility. Government and private-sector actors will also have to consider building market linkages for crops in different areas because farmers might switch crops due to changing land suitability, as described earlier.",
            "Driving adoption of these measures will require solutions at the farm and agriculture-system levels.",
            "We identified several cross-cutting approaches that could help scale priority measures (Table 4). These solutions start with building a climate riskâadjusted agriculture and land management plan that geospatially prioritizes adaptation and mitigation measures at a subnational level and that ties investments to that prioritization. The solutions also include developing financing and incentive mechanisms to encourage on-farm practice shifts (for example, redesigning subsidy schemes, offering tax incentives, and linking farmers to carbon markets); putting system enablers in place (investing more in R&D and scaling traceability systems); and mitigating climate-induced volatility (scaling up crop insurance and integrating climate modeling into food security planning).",
            "Few of these cross-cutting approaches have been applied in practice, given that the discussion of adaptation and mitigation for smallholder farmers is relatively new. However, there are some pilots under way. In China, for example, the government changed its subsidy policies to discourage use of chemical fertilizer for specific crops and encourage the adoption of organic fertilizer substitutes, with a particular focus on reducing nitrogen overapplication. This policy has helped reduce the application of chemical fertilizers by 111.5 kilograms per hectare in pilot counties and increase the use of organic fertilizers by 346.36 kilograms per hectare for sampled farmers. One estimate found that such policy reforms could reduce fertilizer use by 30 percent compared with current rates.",
            "Additionally, the International Food Policy Research Instituteâs modeling of historic data in Punjab, India, has been used to project the effect of removing the subsidy for groundwater extraction, eliminating minimum support price policies for water-intensive crops, and reallocating subsidies to climate-smart technologies such as crop diversification, low tillage, and on-farm rainwater-harvesting ponds with solarized pumps and microirrigation. The modeling suggests there is potential to reduce water consumption by 15 billion cubic meters per year and reduce GHG emissions by 23 million metric tons by 2050. The modeling also finds that there will ultimately be no change to Punjabâs budget if subsidies for groundwater extraction are reallocated as incentives for the adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices.",
            "Development partners and private actors are also implementing pilots to support adoption of climate-smart measures. One Acre Fund, a social enterprise that works with more than one million smallholder farmers in Africa, is expanding an agroforestry program, exploring the link to carbon credit markets to offer incentives for on-farm tree planting.",
            "Others are using financial innovation to support climate-smart agriculture and resilience. F3 Life and Financial Access piloted a Climate-Smart Lending Platform in 2017 with 10,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda. They worked with lenders to develop loan products that featured terms and conditions encouraging farmersâ uptake of climate-smart agricultural and land management practices and use of mobile technology to monitor the adoption of climate-smart farming in compliance with loan agreement requirements.",
            " Pula, an insurance tech start-up in Africa, has provided agriculture insurance to 6.8 million farmers,",
            " including products to address weather-related yield impacts.",
            "Resilience-related infrastructure is being put in place in even the most remote and low-tech contexts. For example, âcontour bundsâ (low walls) combined with Zai pits",
            " have been established in 200,000 to 300,000 hectares of land across the Sahel. The approach almost doubled the yield of cereals, despite frequent droughts.",
            "This is not a comprehensive list of macroscale solutions. But they illustrate some powerful initiatives stakeholders can pursue to support the scaling of adoption of adaptation and mitigation measures among smallholder farmers.",
            "Additionally, actors can support further research to inform decision making. For example, the cost to adopt and scale these measures is largely unexplored in the currently available literature. While we use a qualitative assessment on cost, understanding the true costs is critical in making trade-offs on what measures to choose. Another research question could explore the effectiveness of various measures, particularly regarding adaptation where there is no common metric or set of metrics. Finally, extensive piloting would be helpful to test which macrosolutions are most effective in encouraging farmers to adopt priority measures and to develop and derisk sustainable business models to support adoption.",
            "Smallholder farmers can adopt a range of measures to mitigate and adapt to the risks of climate change. Governments and other stakeholders could consider supporting them in their efforts to adopt sustainable farming practices. In doing so, stakeholders could reflect on the national context in which they are working and collaborate to identify adaptation and mitigation priorities. The prioritization would ultimately act as a North Star and would feed into an agriculture land management plan to inform a more efficient allocation of investment and effort, from innovative financing mechanisms to targeted research and development and technology innovations. Climate change is already creating huge losses for smallholder farmers globally. To achieve a 1.5Â° pathway, responsible actors have no time to lose in supporting the sustainable smallholder farmer community.",

        "paragraphs": [
            " consumer meat market. Meat consumption in China has increased steadily since the early 1990s. In 2021, the Chinese consumed almost 100 million tons of meatâ27Â percent of the worldâs total",
            " and twice the total consumption in the United States.",
            "This article is a collaborative effort by Anne Grimmelt, ",
            ", ",
            ", Cherie Zhang, and Jia Zhou.",
            "But per capita meat consumption in China lags that of western countries. In 2021, per capita consumption was just half that of the United States. This picture is likely to change as increasing urbanization and rising income levels make meat more available and more affordable for Chinese consumers. As more people buy more meat, the patterns of meat consumption will undoubtedly change.",
            "To understand the meat purchasing and eating habits of Chinese consumers, we surveyed about one thousand of them and compared their survey results with the habits of four thousand consumers surveyed in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The survey found a distinct and shifting profile of meat consumption in China, reflected in five trends that executives of meat companies looking to enter this market need to understand.",
            " This is consistent with US and UK meat consumption (Exhibit 1). For these consumers, meat remains central to their diet despite an overall consumer trend of spending more conservatively, according to our 2023 McKinsey China consumer report: A time of resilience.",
            " that is, people committed to eating little or no meat. This result is similar to that of peer survey countries, where 40 to 60 percent of consumers are classified as conscious consumers. Many conscious consumers in China intend to reduce their meat consumption further, though not on the scale of European consumers. Few traditional meat eaters in China share that intention.",
            "Conscious consumers in China are predominantly female and members of the baby boomer generation. Conscious consumers in the peer countries also are predominantly female, but they are younger and more affluent. The fact that Chinaâs baby boomers have embraced conscious consumption comes as no surprise. They grew up eating a traditional Chinese cuisine rich in plant-based protein, especially tofu.",
            "Asked why they limit meat consumption, Chinese conscious consumers cite personal health, diet variety, and priceâfactors related directly to meat products and consumer expectations of those products. Their global peers likewise focus on personal health but then offer two very different reasons: animal welfare and carbon emissions, factors related less directly to meat and more directly to social and environmental concerns (Exhibit 2).",
            " The 57 million tons of pork consumed in China in 2021 accounted for 60 percent of total meat consumption. Most of the Chinese consumers surveyed report purchasing pork in the past monthâa much higher rate than for their global peers (Exhibit 3). Many Chinese consumers eat pork in three to five meals a week or even daily. Note that Chinese cuisine includes myriad ways of cooking pork and features pork in side dishes and dim sum, as well as entrÃ©es.",
            "Poultry, which is perceived as a healthier option, ranks number two on Chinaâs meat menu, with 25Â million tons consumed in 2021. Like their global peers, more than three-quarters of the Chinese consumers surveyed report purchasing poultry in the past month. Poultry consumption grew 7Â percent a year in the period from 2017 to 2021, and annual growth of 1 percent is expected to continue until 2026.",
            "Beef ranks number three on Chinaâs meat menu, with nine million tons consumed in 2021. About two-thirds of the Chinese consumers surveyed report purchasing beef in the past month, but their purchases but do not begin to match US levels. However, beef shows strong growth potential: following annual growth of 4 percent in 2017â21, growth is expected to continue at 2Â percent until 2026.",
            "Chinese consumers report that pork is used in three to five meals a week, compared with 30 percent among their global peers.",
            "Twenty-nine percent of Chinese consumers surveyed especially like the taste of beef.",
            "Twenty percent of Chinese consumers surveyed say that they plan to spend more on beef, 12Â percent plan to spend less, and 68Â percent plan no change in spending. The net result of these changes would be increases of 8 percent in beef consumption and 1 percent in poultry consumption, along with a 6 percent decline in pork consumption.",
            "Seafood, another promising healthy option, is expected to grow 1 to 2 percent a year until 2026.",
            " Chinese consumers, especially those affluent enough to pay more for meat, consider beef healthier than pork. They see the higher price of beef as a sign of a premium productâs higher quality, and they remember the safety issues that have historically been associated with pork. Twenty-eight percent of the Chinese consumers surveyed say they plan to reduce their pork consumption (see sidebar, âHighlights of meat choices by typeâ).",
            "Twenty-eight percent of the Chinese consumers surveyed say they plan to reduce their pork consumption.",
            "Our ",
            "finds the number of top-earning households increasing rapidly. Today, they account for 39Â percent of urban households and 55 percent of urban household consumption (Exhibit 4). By 2025, they will account for more than half of Chinaâs urban households. These consumers stand to have significant influence on meat consumption patterns.",
            "While the emphasis on these buying factors is undoubtedly related to consumersâ growing health concerns, it may also reflect a history of incidents involving meat safety and quality, along with questions about the adequacy of standards in the Chinese meat industry. In addition, the diversity of regional cuisines and cooking methods across China keeps taste top of mind (Exhibit 5).",
            "Affordability ranks a distant third. This is a far cry from the overwhelming attention paid to price in the peer countries studied. In these other countries, price increases and inflation are running rampant, with inflation at four times the rate in China.",
            " ",
            "Growing demand for convenience is shaping new patterns of meat consumption in China.",
            " Like their global peers, Chinese consumers mostly buy uncooked meat for at-home consumption. But as younger consumers exert more purchasing power, convenience looms larger as a key buying factor. These consumers typically feel great work pressure and have little time to cook, so they express interest in prepared meat (precooked or fried) and ready-to-eat meals delivered to their homes.",
            " in contrast to consumers in the peer survey countries, who spend more on meat to eat at home. Chinese restaurants typically use frozen meat, so the growth of the restaurant and catering market (8 percent year over year in 2018â23) promises to increase consumption of frozen meat.",
            "According to our survey, 80 percent of meat purchases happen offline, with half of those purchases made in the traditional wet market. But market trends hint at growth to come. ",
            "Chinese consumers are extremely tech-savvy. Long-standing smartphone ownership has fostered a dynamic digital-commerce marketplace. Consumers already show considerable willingness to buy meat online, and many intend to increase their online purchasing.",
            "Why? The top reasons consumers give to explain their use of online channels include time savings, direct delivery, pandemic-induced desire to avoid human contact, and greater product selection. The pandemic saw online sales of fresh food more than double, from 15 percent to 33 percent, and that shift looks likely to stick postpandemic. ",
            "China is well positioned to handle the growth of online meat sales. The necessary infrastructure, including logistics networks and cold chain technology, is firmly established. The number of online fresh-grocery players is increasing. And lower-income consumers are embracing the concept.",
            ". Promotion of sustainability benefits by meat producers and brands has made Chinese consumers aware of sustainability; many pay attention to sustainability claims when buying meat. This is consistent with consumer awareness in the United Kingdom and the United States but lags behind awareness in Germany. Increasing wealth and sophistication in China also encourage openness to new food concepts.",
            "Across the markets surveyed, the sustainability claims that resonate most strongly with consumers relate directly to meat and personal health: pasture raised or free range and antibiotic free. Claims related to animal welfare (grass fed) weigh heavily with fewer consumers. Even fewer pay much attention to claims related only indirectly to meat (Exhibit 6).",
            "Despite growing awareness of sustainability and the emerging desire to reduce meat consumption, alternative meat has gained little traction in China. Only 6 percent of the consumers surveyed report purchasing alternative meat in the past month, versus 30Â to 40 percent of their global peers. More than 70Â percent of Chinese consumers report rarely or never consuming alternative meat, versus 40Â percent of their global peers.",
            "More than 70 percent of Chinese consumers report rarely or never consuming alternative meat, versus 40 percent of their global peers.",
            "One factor in this limited uptake may be that Chinese consumers lack awareness of the impact of meat consumption on climate changeâa hot topic in Western countries. But Chinese consumers also express strong reservations about alternative meat products. Almost 80 percent dislike the taste of these products, and about 20 percent object to their price. Almost half report having little knowledge of the productsâ nutritional value and considerable concern about additives. All these factors contribute to forecasts of limited demand for alternative meat in China.",
            "Chinaâs huge population and growing middle class suggest significant market demand for real meat over the next decade. The market is expected to grow 1 percent year over year between 2022 and 2026. To capture a meaningful share of this market, global meat players should set entry strategies that reflect insights into Chinese meat consumption.",
            " As Chinese consumers shift meat consumption from pork to protein sources considered to be of higher quality, global players have an opportunity to introduce more premium offerings, especially beef, to the market. Likewise, as convenience-obsessed consumers eat more meals in restaurants, global players have an opportunity to meet the growing demand for frozen meat.",
            "Global players typically have more advanced farming capabilities and operational excellence than local players and may be able to leverage cost efficiency as a competitive advantage. At the same time, global players should carefully consider whether to partner with local players, who would be the best partners, and how a partnership would fit into the broader China operating model. Typically, partnering with midsize local players can help global players enter the market with a relatively limited investment.",
            " While local producers are likely to continue providing the lionâs share of uncooked meat to consumers, global players might focus on the emerging market for prepared meat products. Success would require targeting and marketing to younger consumers, especially those who are more affluent.",
            "Global players should embrace the online sales channel. This channel, which already accounts for 5 to 10 percent of meat sales, is relatively advanced in China. The offline channel is fragmented and requires local resources, but the online channel is open for global business and is better suited to the branded, premium products that global players would bring.",
            ". Beyond communicating the health and sustainability benefits of products, global players should ensure that their products deliver on those promisesâfor example, by improving product safety.",
            "Global players looking to anchor their strategy in concepts new to Chinese consumers, such as the health benefits of alternative meat or the role of animal welfare in sustainability, will have to recognize the limited awareness and understanding of these concepts among consumers, especially those living outside of major cities. Success would require investing significant time and resources to educate targeted consumers and build the market for relevant products. Making these efforts context specificâfor example, linking new plant-based protein products to Chinaâs long history of eating tofuâmight greatly enhance the odds of success.",
            "Protein will not disappear from consumersâ diets. The question is, how will they consume it, and how will they make that decision? Accurate answers to this question can give global players an advantage in serving Chinaâs consumers.",

            " challenge. There are multiple barriers to scaling from an industry perspectiveâsuch as fragmentation, lack of standard data architecture, and cross-platform interoperability. In this article, we evaluate the challenges related to farmer adoption, sharing the âvoice from the field.â",
            "With recent increases in on-farm profitability and strong investments over the last decade, there is a high openness to innovation, yet adoption is slow. On one hand, most farmers have benefited from the macroeconomic tailwinds of global commodity cycles; in 2021, on-farm income in many regions was at its highest level in almost a decade and was projected to remain at near record highs in 2022.",
            " On the other hand, inflationary pressures are mounting and farmers are facing an onslaught of challengesâhaving to scrutinize weather forecasts, be aware of shifts in the regulatory landscape, or face evolving consumer preferences, rising costs from inflation, and unreliable supply chains.",
            "Meanwhile, external capital has been pouring into the upstream agriculture food-technology industry to the tune of about $18.2 billion in 2021, an approximate 38 percent year-on-year growth since 2013.",
            " This influx of capital has brought with it a plethora of technological solutions to the agriculture space. Over the past decade, the number of farmer-facing agtech start-ups has ballooned. Farmers can now harness software, hardware, and service-based solutions that promise to increase efficiency, ease pain points, and lower their environmental footprint.",
            "Even with need driving funding availability, agtech start-ups are struggling to scale. In ",
            " on agtech funding over the last decade, we showed that most deals are occurring in the Seed and Series A rounds. Far fewer start-ups, however, are receiving later-stage funding or going public, suggesting that agtech start-ups are not able to build the requisite customer base to transition to these funding rounds.",
            "In some areas, agtech solutions are already driving the next level of farm productivity by reducing operational costs and enabling less resource-intensive growth. To gain a deeper understanding of how agtech usage may differ across regions globally, and what barriers may be impeding broader adoption, we surveyed 5,500 row- and specialty-crop farmers in 2022 across Asia, Europe, North America, and South America.",
            " Farmersâ responses reveal that agtech adoption varies markedly across geographies, and that hesitant adopters are particularly wary of unclear ROI and high prices (Exhibit 1).",
            "European and North American farmers lead global agtech adoption, with about 61 percent currently using or planning to adopt one agtech product in the next two years. North American farmers cite high costs (52 percent) and unclear ROI (40 percent) as their biggest challenges to adopting farm-management systems. Farmers in Europe, while also most concerned about high costs (48 percent), report complexities in setup and use as an additional major barrier to adoption (32 percent). Farmers in South America (50 percent) follow in agtech adoption, with differences in adoption observed between countries within each region. South American farmers are the most apprehensive about trust in the purchasing process through online platforms (33 percent). Agtech product adoption is lowest in Asia, with only about 9 percent of farmers using or planning to use at least one agtech product; adoption varies between countries in this region as well.",
            "Looking at agtech submarkets, farm-management software has the highest adoption among farmers at 21 percent, followed closely by a 15 percent utilization of remote-sensing and precision agriculture hardware. Sustainability-related technology (such as software and hardware that measure carbon emissions and sequestration, and monitor and optimize irrigation systems), and automation and roboticsâtechnologies that are still in their infancyâlag at about 5 percent adoption. Over the next two years, limited growth is projected across categories, with roughly 4 percent of farmers saying they plan to adopt either farm-management software, precision-agriculture hardware, remote-sensing solutions, or sustainability-related technologies, while additional automation and robotics adoption is projected to be slightly lower, at around 2.5 percent.",

            " include satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle solutions that monitor crop growth and identify both biotic and abiotic stressors in a high-throughput manner.",
            " include online commodity trading platforms, digital marketplaces tailored to input purchasing, and products providing greater insight into food safety, traceability, and logistic support.",
            " include advanced field machinery designed to reduce labor needs, optimize field operations, increase productivity of input application, and reduce operating costs.",
            "Five trends arise across six farmer-facing agtech submarkets. (See sidebar, âSix major farmer-facing agtech submarkets.â) Some trends are cross-cutting, while the impact of others is disproportionate across certain agtech submarkets:",
            "Shifting pressures are leading farmers to be more open to agtech innovations as potential tools to optimize their returns and minimize their financial risk. Thirty-nine percent of farmers surveyed globally are currently using or planning to use at least one agtech product in the next two years. To improve their bottom lines, 43 percent of surveyed farmers are focused on trying new products to increase yield, while almost a quarter (22 percent) are planning to change purchasing and vendor strategies.",
            "Rising input prices are currently the greatest worry that farmers face, with 67 percent citing increased input prices as one of their top three concerns for profitability over the next two years. Their unease is well-founded, as farmers globally report that their input prices have risen between around 80 percent and 250 percent in the last few years. South American farmers have been the hardest hit (at about 247 percent), while Asiaâs input costs (around 82 percent) are the least affected. Though farmers are currently producing food under elevated sales price conditions, the volatility of the commodity marketsâcombined with rising input pricesâintroduces great uncertainty on future profitability. As past economic cycles have shown, the delay in time between input production, purchase, and application means that a dip in commodity prices does not immediately mirror a drop in input prices, adding strain to farmersâ bottom lines. Farmers are thus motivated to offset this uncertainty by optimizing their yieldsâan opportunity to introduce agtech innovations to their farming strategies.",
            "Across all markets, large farmsâmore than 5,000 acresâare the most willing to adopt agtech solutions (81 percent), with 76 percent of medium farms (2,000 to 5,000 acres) and 36 percent of small farms (fewer than 2,000 acres) using or planning to use at least one technology in the next two years.",
            "Agtech adoption is not uniform across regions and, in some cases, there is substantial variation between countries within regionsâboth in terms of the percentage of farmers using agtech, and the agtech submarkets they adopt. Farm-management software is the most common submarket among North American farmers. In South America, remote-sensing technology is the highest use case (23 percent), and Brazilian farmers outpace Argentinian farmers in adoption across most agtech submarkets. European farmers show considerable variation by country, as well as within submarkets. For example, agribusiness marketplace adoption is highest in Germany at 13 percent, whereas precision-agriculture hardware usage is highest in the Netherlands at 33 percent. In Asia, farmers in India currently use more agtech products than those in China across all submarkets.",
            "Instead of targeting the adoption of individual agtech solutions, the current environment is likely to encourage farmers to focus attention on combining two key submarkets: farm-management software systems and precision-agriculture hardware solutions. These two innovations work in concert to optimize fertilizer and pesticide usage and tailor seeding rates. Farm-management software systems are particularly promising because they can equip farmers with the information needed to evaluate and manage how they utilize large value pools, including inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, and pesticides. These systems are further enhanced when precision-agriculture hardware solutions are deployed to conduct input application in the field. For example, optimizing input application through variable rate applications, especially when coupled with advanced guidance systems and automatic shutoffs, gives farmers greater control at preventing site-specific over-application.",
            "As the physical and economic impacts of climate change worsen, global consumers and investors are turning to sustainable food systems. ",
            " shows that nearly 30 percent of respondents have increased their consumption of more sustainable food products since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our most recent analysis of agtech funding in 2022 indicated that nearly one-third of start-ups have a sustainability-focused value proposition. This suggests that both start-ups and investors are responding to these changes in consumer preferences and broader societal trends.",
            "However, results from our survey show that the direct adoption of agtech has yet to align with investor and consumer sentimentâsuch as sustainability-related technologies and those that support the transition to more sustainable farming practices.",
            "Europe and North America lead the use of sustainability-related technology, but at 9 percent adoption, there is opportunity for agtech to grow in these regions. There is also growth opportunity in other parts of the world, with only a 6 percent adoption rate globally. Even where adoption of sustainable farming practices is higher, use of sustainability-related technologies is still low. For example, as shown in our â",
            "â survey, Brazil is a leader in the use of biologicals (55 percent) and low-till practices (83 percent), though its adoption of sustainability-related technology is as low as 10 percent.",
            "Precision-agriculture hardware, which is a major driver for sustainable, low-emission farming practices, is utilized the most in North America (28 percent), followed closely by South America (27 percent), and Europe at 21 percent. The solutions showing the most enthusiastic adoption are yield mapping and monitoring software (69 percent), variable rate fertilizer-application technology (67 percent), and automatic sprayer-section shutoffs (67 percent). Asia is still catching up, with only 4 percent adoption of overall sustainability-related technology categories (Exhibit 2).",
            "Farmers can leverage agtech more deliberately to support the broader adoption of sustainable farming practices. To participate in sustainability programs, farmers are not only expected to adopt sustainable practices, but to also verify compliance and continually measure their impact. This includes measuring soil organic carbon to verify carbon sequestrationâfor many carbon programs, for example, three to nine yearsâ worth of historical data are required depending on crop rotation. These cover specific data points such as tillage history, yield data, soil-sampling results, and crop inputs. In total, up to 100 different data fields need to be collected and recorded during the growing season to meet validation and verification requirements. Farmers are further expected to provide up to 100 years in permeance requirements for carbon sequestration to prove that a reversal has not occurred.",
            " Sustainability-related technologies that support measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV), as well as data-collection technologies such as remote sensing, are starting to address the burdensome data requirements and will likely play an important role as farmers transition toward more sustainable practices.",
            "Regulation already plays a critical role in shaping the future of agtechâour survey data show that government-sponsored programs are the main drivers of sustainability-program adoption, with about 40 percent of farmers reporting that they participate in these initiatives.",
            "Regulatory changes proposed over the past three to five years in various countries are likely to affect the direction of agtech adoption and innovation. For example, Europeâs proposed Green Deal (parts of which focuses on overall reduction and exposure to agricultural inputs) is widely expected to have a moderating impact on farmersâ fertilizer and pesticide usage.",
            " There are also proposed changes to Canadaâs 2030 Emission Reduction Plan that aim to lower emissions from fertilizer application.",
            " These are likely to drive the adoption of agtech innovations such as farm-management software solutions and precision-agriculture technologiesâalongside a shift toward using inputs with lower greenhouse-gas emissions.",
            "In practice, agtech solutions have the potential to support farmers in optimizing the application of high-emission inputs. For example, high-resolution fertility mapping, when coupled with variable-rate applications of fertilizer, can both optimize and increase productivity of fertilizer usage and prevent over application. The combination of AI-backed machine vision and automatic nozzle shutoffs on GPS-guided spray equipment can also significantly maximize the efficiency of herbicide application and prevent costly overlap.",
            "In addition to concerns about biodiversity loss and water pollution through the overuse of chemical fertilizers, a pertinent issue affecting farming globally is the collision of rising global temperatures and declining freshwater poolsâboth visible and underground. Water management is likely to gain more attention, receiving increasing societal and regulatory pressure. New solutions can be found in agtech to address freshwater usage and waste from agricultural practices. For example, remote-sensing technologies that detect plant health or stress, soil-moisture sensors that communicate with irrigation systems, advanced weather-forecasting solutions, and the software interfaces that connect them all, could be effective tools in increasing the sustainability and social responsibility of farm irrigation practices.",
            "Despite start-up and investment interest in farm-management software solutions, cost is a major barrier for farmers, with 47 percent of respondents citing it as a top concern (Exhibit 3).",
            "In fact, 50 percent of farmers globally are unwilling to pay for these solutions at allâthis may be because input manufacturers, distributors, and equipment companies have historically offered deep discounts or no-charge subscriptions to comprehensive digital platforms, leaving farmers to question the ROI of newer offerings.",
            "Although there is higher agtech adoption in larger farms, the number of small and medium farms with limited adoption in the developed world presents a significant market opportunity, though product offerings would need to be tailored for these operations. For farms of all sizes and income levels, ease of access would enable agtechâs potential to positively impact livelihoods and the environment globally.",
            "A clearer value proposition that focuses on ROI will likely encourage more adoptionâ30 percent of farmers cited an unclear ROI as a top barrier to adoption and, based on their responses, the minimum-expected ROI to consider adoption is 3:1. This suggests that the current solutionsâ impacts arenât easily measurable. Agtech companies are presently trying to move away from one-time purchases and flat-fee annual renewals of software or solutions and focus more on business-model adaptation and exploration. They are also shifting toward monetizing solutions with combinations of hardware, software, services, and analytical innovations to enhance the financial viability of their businesses.",
            "Usage-based models (for example, $/per acre, $/per module/per acre) are by far the most common pricing models, with prices as low as $1 an acre to as high as $60 an acre. Despite the attractiveness of these models to agtech players, even products in the lower per-acre price range have struggled to scale. Demonstrating the ROI of agtech solutions to farmers is challenging. Productivity gains (such as yield increase and yield stability) are confounded by a host of variables that affects overall performance. For example, external factors (including extreme weather events) often mask any improvements, especially where farmers are only testing the solutions on select areas of land.",
            "Models with fewer up-front expenditures for hardware, such as leasing or renting, and scalable pricing structures (for instance, per acre, module, or sensor) are expected to be the easiest models with which to grow adoption. This may be particularly relevant in the upcoming years where 31 percent of farmers are projecting lower profits than in years before.",
            "Now that agtech suppliers can offer more than one-off point solutions, there is increased interest in building digital capabilities and marketplaces. By leveraging farmer data, integrated players (such as input retailers) are increasingly motivated to gain meaningful insights into their customersâ behaviors, hoping to identify synergistic opportunities for up-sell and cross-sell.",
            "Given agtech suppliersâ increasing interest in the value of farmer data, and their accompanying digital channels and cloud-based software offerings, the underlying assumption has been that data-ownership worries harbored by farmers will not persistâhowever, survey results indicate that is not the case.",
            "Beside cost and ROI, farmers remain concerned about whom has access to their data, with 20 percent of farmers globally citing this as a top barrier for adopting farm-management software. Farmers in North America lead all regions in their concerns about data sharing (25 percent), whereas Asian farmers are the least concerned (18 percent). Products that offer greater personalization and provide science-backed, actionable insights around input optimization are the ones most likely to foster trust and gain traction in the current inflationary environment.",
            "This is particularly important when developing agtech products that are meant to have functionality for both specialty- and row-crop farmers, as there are distinctions between crop physiology, cultural practices, grades, and end-market uses for each. Platforms that are designed for row-crop farmers and then are applied to specialty-crop farmers are unlikely to achieve farmer buy-in and create impact. Instead, companies wishing to support specialty-crop farmers could focus on a systems approach to develop actionable insights that cater to the interdependencies of all facets of production.",
            "Digital channels by which farmers learn about and acquire products also require further attention. Despite start-up and incumbent interest in online platforms, survey results suggest that fewer than 12 percent of farmers globally strongly prefer to buy products online. When asked about what makes them hesitant to shop online, farmers indicate that online storefronts do not provide a satisfactory customer experience or offer customized recommendations (Exhibit 4). This is more important in certain product categories than othersâfor example, evaluating new seed varieties requires more dialogue with sales experts, compared to the routine purchase of equipment replacement parts.",
            "Surveyed farmers perceive agronomists to be the most trustworthy source of information, followed by neighboring farmers, sales representatives, and lastly, online sources.",
            " This may be because agronomists often have deep regional expertise, local ties, and are able to tailor recommendations to farmersâ needs, while providing one-on-one connection by visiting and phoning farmers.",
            ", shows that agtech solution providers have an opportunity to blend technical innovation with local knowledge to provide tailored recommendations to farmers. Current pain points and further adoption could be addressed by concurrently analyzing past growing behaviors, harnessing advancements in satellite imaging and machine learning to circumvent the need for up-front data sharing, and drawing on hyperlocal agronomic insights from agronomists, sales representatives, and other experts.",
            "The agtech space offers immense opportunities to stimulate farmer buy-in, but more work lies ahead to drive adoption. We have identified four key areas:",
            "Farmers are currently facing immense challenges: price increases, extreme weather events, shifting consumer behavior, and a changing regulatory environment. Agtech has an opportunity to play an even more central roleâif there is a concerted focus on solving the persistent challenges of the past decade around ROI, cost, and data gathering. When done well, greater agtech adoption can lead to more inclusive and sustainable growth for farmers, and benefit conscious consumers and investors beyond the farm gate.",

Despite recent high-tech upheavals, applicants with in-demand skills have become more selective when it comes to choosing and prioritizing potential employers. Based on findings from McKinsey survey data (see sidebar âAbout the researchâ), with 80 percent of CEOs ranking new-business building as a top five priority,",
            " demand for tech talent is expected to grow from 9.2 million jobs in the United States in 2022 to 9.4 million in 2023,",
            " and the tech workforce will grow twice as fast as the overall US workforce in the next ten years.",
            "the needs and considerations of software talent in this period of extreme labor market attrition, we conducted a survey of 1,532 US workers with tech-related backgrounds who were employed in one of five software-related job families across industries. The survey included 299 software engineers, 307 product managers, 307 cloud engineers, 310 data scientists, and 309 software-as-a-service (SaaS) administrators. This software-tech-specific survey builds on our broader research into the phenomenon known as the ",

We made these distinctions because the information talent has on an organization, and the elements they prioritize, may differ in each context. These distinctions, therefore, have nuanced implications for organizationsâ attraction and retention efforts. ",
            "We defined the five key job families as follows: ",

            ".â Approximately 70 percent of automotive leaders are focused on building new businesses, yet there are critical talent capability gaps that require new skill sets (for example, software engineering and product management). To attract and keep the best candidates, mobility incumbents launching or scaling new businesses should take action to position themselves to attract potential high-tech recruits across the four dimensions that comprise an effective employee value proposition (EVP): great job, great people, great rewards, great company.  ",
            "Demand for talent in the technology industry has been exceptionally competitive. In 2022, the US tech sector added nearly 260,000 jobs, according to CompTIA, the most in a single year since 2000. And this demand for tech talent has been sustained into 2023. As a result, the sectorâs unemployment rate rose from 1.5 percent in January to 2.3 percent at the end of April, still well below the national rate of 3.6 percent. ",
            "Nonetheless, these skills remain in high demand, and tech talent is still largely a âsellerâs market.â What has changed is that tech workers are reevaluating their relationships with their companies. While 80 percent of laid-off tech talent found new jobs within two to four months, layoffs are new to the younger generation of talent, causing them to rethink their indispensability within their âdreamâ companies.",
            "Incumbent automotive and mobility players building innovative new businesses can attract and retain high-tech talent in what could be a once-in-a-generation realignment. As noted in â",
            ",â incumbents have specific strengths, such as existing customer bases, established brands, and physical product experience, that allow them to attract talent that is eager to build new businesses.",
            "To understand the connection between building new businesses and attracting and retaining new tech talent, it makes sense to examine an incumbentâs EVP. The EVP outlines the expectations and commitments of the employeeâemployer relationship; it can help to attract talent, align proper incentives, boost employee productivity, and drive long-term commitment.",

            "Progress on one factor can have ripple effects across the entire EVP. For instance, improvements in career development, mentoring, community, or reputation will not simply produce isolated benefits to those specific sections of the EVP because of the overlaps among many of the areas (exhibit). Better career development can include better mentoring, which creates a better community, resulting in an overall better-perceived reputation.",
            "The four tenets noted above represent the best ways incumbent automotive and mobility players can attract and retain skilled high-tech talent. We will examine each in greater detail.",
            "To attract and keep the best tech talent, jobs need clear career development paths and interesting work content to show recruits they wonât end up on a tech-focused dead-end path, but instead will have a straight shot at achieving meaningful career goals. Jobs should offer sufficient freedom and autonomy, supported by appropriate coaching, feedback, and mentorship. ",
            "Career development is the single-most-cited factor considered among people evaluating their jobs (43 percent of respondents). Career development includes  several related areas, such as developing skills, advancing within the organization, learning new skill sets, and moving horizontally within the organization. As mentioned in the article â",
            ",â career development is the most important reason cited by individuals who decide to stay in their current job, as well as the most important reason cited by individuals who take the leap and transition to a new jobâboth in terms of describing their past position (citing a lack of opportunities) and their new position (attracted by new development opportunities).",
            " ",
            "It is also the second-highest spur for respondents who plan to leave their jobs but have not yet done so (the highest is compensation).",
            "Most traditional career progress models trend toward management roles. This limits career growth opportunities for top talent who are uninterested in management roles but instead seek other ways to grow within their expertise domain. New business launches should offer openings to rotate people horizontally and find topics that match their interests. Additionally, career development models should provide technical knowledge growth paths as an alternative to management positions, such as expert paths.",
            "Among people who ranked overall career development as an important factor, nine in ten who chose a new company did so because it placed a strong emphasis on developing skills, knowledge, and abilities. Furthermore, 80 to 90 percent saw opportunities to learn from top talent in the field.",
            "Skill development communities within a company are additional ways for technology and start-up engineers to develop their technical skills over time (for instance, guilds and communities of practice). ",
            "New businesses can focus on coaching, feedback, and mentorship by incorporating elements such as feedback loops, mobile learning, nudges, personalization, and microlearning. These are new tools that automotive and mobility incumbents are typically either not leveraging or have only nascent experiments under way but that represent an opportunity for new businesses to lead the charge in the transition to build a stronger feedback and skill-building culture.",
            "The third-largest factor in job evaluation is workplace flexibility (34 percent), which encompasses control over the how, where, and when employees do their work (see sidebar âPresenting the right job: A case studyâ). Agile approaches constitute the âhowâ of making work more attractive to high-tech talent. Incumbents can increase their agile ways of working by considering a restructuring of the hierarchy into a network of empowered teams and introducing centers of competence that build individual and company expertise. The âwhenâ and âwhereâ are more straightforward to imagine, involving flextime, work-at-home, or âwork on the flyâ scenarios, although these can be potentially challenging to execute.",
            "Rewards can come in many forms, including compensation and noncompensation benefits such as better control over where and when a person works, flexible schedules, and paid time off (PTO). ",
            " Total compensation is the second-most-cited factor considered by individuals evaluating their job (38.5 percent of respondents). It is the most common reason technology-focused hires plan to leave a job (37 percent) and the second-most-common reason for taking a new job (45 percent). Incumbents should be prepared to pay a higher total compensation package for tech talent compared with traditional employees. Additionally, 72 percent of respondents who cited total compensation as a reason for leaving said their total compensation does not adequately reflect their qualifications and effort.  ",
            "Given these findings, when incumbents hire for tech roles, they should consider offering a mix of cash and, where a new independent venture is being launched, equity that aligns incentives to new venture performance.  ",
            "Furthermore, incumbents can offer candidates more flexible compensation packages compared with start-ups, including virtual stock options for innovative minds and larger fixed-salary components for those seeking greater stability, instead of the volatility commonly experienced in tech and start-up environments. ",
            " Incumbents with new business launches can also offer noncompensation benefits to increase their talent attraction and retention power. Benefits could include increased work perks such as parental leave, enhanced medical coverage, fertility treatments, investment assistance, volunteer days, and unlimited PTO (see sidebar âOffering the right rewards: A case studyâ). Alternative offerings can also include on-site provisions such as free food, laundry, or fitness facilities that reduce daily personal-life stress, even a four-day workweek. One four-day workweek trial study in the United Kingdom",
            " recently announced that more than 90 percent of the companies in the trial indicated a preference to continue with the four-day workweek, and other companies have revealed they are considering it as well. ",
            " Research reveals that 40 percent of technology hires who took a new job said one reason for doing so was the opportunity to advance in the new organization. For incumbent automotive players, this makes it vitally important to ensure new business launches are meritocracies. OEMs can establish their new businesses as meritocracies by hiring talented managers who are knowledgeable about the new businessâs product lines, by sourcing the best talent available through a mix of internal and external hiring rather than just the former, and by having objective and transparent review processes. This should be true across several tech-related domains (for example, data science, cloud architecture, connected-technology platforms, and customer experience design). ",
            "On the other hand, new business launches must be wary of tenure-based promotions and those based on subjective scoring. Evidence of nonmeritocratic career progression can discourage top talent, thus reducing attraction and retention. ",
            "Senior leaders and direct managers who have a demonstrated track record of people leadership and maintaining workâlife balance in the larger tech community can be catalysts for any effort to attract and retain top tech talent. ",
            "Survey respondents indicate that having caring and inspiring leaders is a top ten factor in evaluating their job (24 percent of all respondents) and an important factor for taking on a new job. Tech and start-up talent seeks companies with senior leaders who have vision, patience, tenacity, authenticity, and self-awareness. In a new business launch, vision means more than simply caring about end goals; it means having a holistic target from engineering to business outcomes that shows consideration for all members and teams. Senior leaders should focus on outlining and communicating a strong vision and execution plan while expressing their unwavering support for the new launch. This can be achieved through company-wide town halls that are informative, provide recognition, and allow for questions and transparent communication. In a similar vein, company-wide âask me anythingâ sessions with senior leaders can provide clarity on the corporate mission and drive enthusiasm for new business ventures.",
            "Managers with leadership skills and the right capabilities are needed to drive new business launches that successfully attract and retain tech and start-up talent. Key capabilities include a solid grounding in customer experience, a strong market orientation, leading-edge business acumen, and both technical and leadership skills. Enabling direct managers who are middle managers to perform their people management duties is essential to their satisfaction and the growth of their teams. Surveyed middle managers",
            " indicated that they spend half of their working time on nonmanagerial duties, such as administrative tasks and work that they are individually responsible for, while only 28 percent of their time is spent engaging in talent and people management work. ",
            "Placing increased value on talent and people management activities will incentivize managers to spend more working time engaged in these activities, which, in turn, can provide the mentorship and career development sought out by tech talent.",
            "Reliable and supportive people at work is another top ten factor in job evaluation. Additionally, it is a top five reason why people choose to stay in their current job, with 40 percent of respondents mentioning it. New business launches can build and cultivate communities to mirror those in tech firms and start-ups, which are highly effective at growing and retaining talent (see sidebar âHaving the right people: A case studyâ). Connectivity opportunities, such as one-on-one coffee chats with senior leaders, can contribute to enhancing community bonds while providing important connections for career growth. Incumbents can consider structures such as guilds, which can positively impact career development while also forging a sense of belonging by grouping together people with similar interests and skill sets. ",
            "An incumbent automotive playerâs brand, reputation, and impact on society can all play pivotal roles in attracting and convincing high-tech workers to make a long-term home with the company. ",
            " Industry incumbents have an advantage over new entrants in this regard because they often enjoy a rich history of success, which can create a sense of loyalty that is not as easy to build from scratch at a start-up. Additionally, an incumbentâs often lengthy history leads to greater trust in the company, which solidifies its stability, attracting employees who want the fast-paced and innovative growth environment of tech while avoiding the volatility associated with start-ups. Incumbents can leverage their rich history to tell a compelling story, not only to their customers but also to their employees as they look toward the future (see sidebar âBeing the right company: A case studyâ). ",
            "Sustainable work performance is a top five factor in job evaluation (28 percent) and the fifth most important factor for new job seekers (34 percent). The nature of tech and start-ups can sometimes blur the lines between work and life, but incumbents can offer a haven from potential burnout by promoting a workplace lifestyle that emphasizes work is not life and vice versa. After COVID-19, employee health and well-being became center stage for most job evaluators. The sixth-most-important factor cited is âsupport for employee health and well-being.â It is the second-highest reason why people have left their jobs. Auto companies can demonstrate a culture of caring rather than a culture driven by âgrowth at the expense of employees.â  ",
            " Top talent are seeking meaningful work with companies that are making a sustained impact and that demonstrate corporate values aligned with their personal values and aspirations. For job seekers looking for meaningful work in sustainability, automotive incumbents may not be the first companies they seek out. Incumbents should transparently promote the progress they have achieved through innovation across a number of meaningful areas such as sustainable products, materials, manufacturing, and emissions reduction.",
            "Examination of the full EVP can be complemented by the review of external sources of feedback to truly understand the needs of high-tech talent in the market. Incumbents can understand the biggest pain points of tech-focused employees and prospects by collating engagement survey feedback, findings from exit interviews, feedback from prospects who did not accept offers, as well as reviews on third-party websites such as Glassdoor and Teamblind.",
            "Incumbent automotive and mobility players launching new businesses have a unique, once-in-a-generation opportunity to attract high-tech talent by capitalizing on a fast hiring process as well as the fidelity and rigor of their existing hiring standards. With the combination of a start-upâs freedom and autonomy and an incumbentâs stability, deep pockets, and reputation, these companies can offer high-tech talent a complete package that other start-ups and incumbents without such enterprises canât match. Well positioned to grow in the current climate (and, therefore, to attract talent), they can emphasize different elements of the EVP to deliver a rich and fulfilling experience to best influence this talent for the new businesses they are building.

        "description": "As the transition to electric cars gains momentum in India, new consumer needs are emerging related to product features, charging, channel preferences, flexible ownership models, and more.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " a future of electric vehicles (EVs): 70 percent of tier-one Indian car consumers state that theyâre willing to consider an electric car for their next vehicle, as compared to the record-high global average of 52 percent. Even though the Indian internal-combustion engine (ICE) vehicle market has seen an increase in recent years,",
            " the rapid transition to electrification signifies a decisive inflection point for the country. Driven by a shift in global climate policies, central and state governments have introduced initiatives such as the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme to speed up the adoption of EVs. In addition, several cities have introduced access regulations for ICE vehicles to reduce air pollution and improve traffic conditions.",
            "At the same time, EVs have become increasingly accessible. Incumbent car manufacturers have announced ambitious product-portfolio electrification targets. Newcomers have launched models specifically designed for Indiaâs urban environments. And the total cost of ownership for EVs, which is historically an obstacle for EV purchasers, achieved parity with ICE vehicles. As a result, EV market penetration is projected to grow to 10 to 15 percent by 2030,",
            " creating a significant opportunity for OEMs, financial institutions, grid operators, and other stakeholders.",
            "To better understand consumer sentiment about vehicle electrification in India, we surveyed people across income levels and spanning regions in India (see sidebar, âMethodologyâ). Their responses reveal both an appetite for and concerns regarding electric vehicles, including the importance of sustainability, charging infrastructure, and the evolving purchase journey in the online space.",
            "Consumer sentiment suggests the transition to electric cars will gain momentum. The vast majority of people are eyeing EVs for their next car purchase, with a clear preference for full battery electric vehicles (49 percent) over plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (21 percent) (Exhibit 1). These preferences align closely with our research on electric two-wheelers, which showed that 86 percent of consumers would consider buying an EV compared to 69 percent who would consider an ICE vehicle. A number of factors are contributing to this appetite for EVs, with potential purchasers noting the impact on the environment (67 percent), lower total cost of ownership (26 percent), and reduced engine noise (26 percent) as the biggest benefits of driving an EV.",
            "Indeed, an overall concern for sustainability is influencing Indian consumersâ desire for EVs, with sustainability being the number one priority in car-buying and mobility-usage habits. In fact, sustainability is increasingly influencing consumer decisions across the board in India: 75 percent of Indians are starting to change (or have already changed) their behavior and consumption patterns based on sustainability considerations. Of these changes, engaging with and becoming more loyal to sustainable brands (27 percent), positively advocating for sustainable products and services (23 percent), and trying sustainable products and services more often (20 percent) are the most common.",
            "Sustainability is among the top five criteria people factor in when considering a car, along with safety, brand, and costs (Exhibit 2). The desire for zero-carbon vehicles is also evident in the dominant two-wheeler market, in which this preference was one of the top three purchase criteria.",
            "Alongside all this momentum for sustainable mobility, there emerge real concerns that could influence uptake, including battery life and safety, purchase price, charging time, and reliability of technology. Better availability of charging points is one of the biggest factors influencing the shift toward electric mobility. Perceived charging infrastructure readiness is low: more than 75 percent of all surveyed consumers feel that India is not yet well set up in terms of charge points (Exhibit 3).",
            "Indian consumers show almost equal affinity for public and home charging (58 percent and 42 percent, respectively) despite appreciating the latter as being cheaper, more convenient, and more accessible. However, only 55 percent of consumers have access to home charging, while another 30 percent would be able to upgrade their home setup accordingly. But even though Indian consumers have limited access to home charging, this will likely not hinder EV adoption. Two-thirds of Indian consumers would buy an EV even if they could not charge at home. But similar to what we found in our research on electric two-wheelers, 38 percent of consumers feel their nearby areas lack a sufficient network of charging infrastructure. Hence, investing in both public and home charging is critical for further EV adoption. The biggest factors influencing where people choose to charge in public are charging speed (49 percent) and costs (41 percent), followed by the safety of the location (28 percent). In fact, most people are willing to pay 10 to 20 percent more for the convenience of fast charging.",
            "Another significant factor influencing potential EV purchasers was the test drive experience. Of the people who are currently skeptical about purchasing an EV, 24 percent said the test drive experience presents an important tipping point in the overall purchase journey. Thus, OEMs can consider implementing long-term test rides (over the course of seven to ten days) with the convenience of at-home services to eliminate customer anxiety while adopting new products and technology.",
            "Other major factors that could lead to higher EV adoption are vehicle safety improvements and providing better servicing infrastructure. Furthermore, an increase in fuel prices and a better understanding of the total cost of ownership of EVs might nudge more customers toward EVs.",
            "As the transition to EVs unfolds, the landscape for buying and selling cars is changing dramatically. Indian consumers are open to buying cars online and want to interact with brands through a simplified, digital process that provides more flexibility and convenience. The majority of Indian customers are ready to perform most of their car purchase journey digitally. More than 70 percent of consumers are starting their journey online, and about 40 percent of consumers are willing to make purchases online. However, about 90 percent of the same consumers need a physical touchpoint with an OEM or dealer. This applies to highly individual exchanges such as test-drives, services, answering questions about the vehicle, or negotiating best deals.",
            "Across each major touchpoint of the purchasing journey, people who prefer to engage via websites and apps show a strong preference for engaging with OEMs rather than a dealer or third party (Exhibit 4). This indicates an emergence of hybrid direct-to-consumer models, with car dealers continuing to play a pivotal (but evolved) role in the overall purchase and post-purchase journey.",
            "Flexible ownership options are also becoming more popular with Indian consumers. While most consumers (about 79 percent) still prefer an outright purchase for their next car, they are gradually opting for more-flexible ownership options such as car leasing, subscriptions, or pay-per-use models.",
            "Shifting ownership preferences, stemming from a desire to access higher-value assets and have more flexibility and convenience, are opening new market opportunities for flexible ownership options, such as leasing. Our global survey revealed that consumers in other geographies are willing to switch brands for flexible vehicle purchase, indicating that the time is ripe for market players to adapt.",
            "These trends raise important considerations for different stakeholders in the mobility ecosystem as they work to meet consumers where they are in their journey toward EVs.",
            "In many cases, electric cars could become an important pocket of growth for car manufacturers. The contribution of electric cars to overall revenues may become more significant in the future as consumer pull accelerates and governmental measures become even more favorable. With a fast-growing market open to innovations in car purchasing (for example, via online channels) and usage (for example, fully leased), electric cars may provide an entry opportunity for new players. At the same time, car dealers may need to adjust their sales and service offerings to accommodate the growing demand for electric cars, including expanding their technical knowledge and digital capabilities to deliver omnichannel experiences. Supplier stakeholders such as grid operators will most likely experience an increased demand for electricity and may need to upgrade and expand the existing infrastructure and integrate new technologies to optimize the use of the electrical grid. And cities will be crucial players in shaping the EV transition, providing the infrastructural conditions for charging needs and implementing effective policy measures.",

        "description": "Today’s consumers in India prefer electric two-wheelers due to availability of multiple product choices, reliable technology features, evolving consumer buying journeys, and flexible ownership models.",
        "paragraphs": [
            "In India, the future of two-wheelers, such as motorcycles and scooters, is bright and electric. Owing to their accessibility and affordability, these vehicles have long been an integral part of Indiaâs mobility ecosystem, accounting for more than 70 percent of all vehicles.",
            " And consumers are ready to take them electric: by 2030, electric two-wheelers are expected to account for 60 to 70 percent of new sales in India.",
            " Consumers are not only prepared to purchase more electric two-wheelers but are also evolving their buying journeys by embracing more omnichannel experiences.",
            "The increased use of electric two-wheelers will support Indiaâs alignment with global climate policies, central- and state-government initiatives (such as FAME [Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles]), and city access regulations aimed at reducing air pollution and improving traffic conditions. However, concerns about vehicle safety, battery life, and lack of charging infrastructure could present challenges in achieving full market penetration sooner.",
            "We sought out to understand consumer behavior and preferences amid this rapid shift toward two-wheeler electrification. A survey of roughly 1,200 Indian electric-vehicle (EV) consumers underscored the importance of product preferences, channel preferences, ownership models, and affinity for premium features (see sidebar, âMethodologyâ).",
            "The granular survey data also allowed us to segment the mobility consumer landscape into seven archetypical consumer groups based on their mobility usage and psychography. Two-wheeler mobility is particularly relevant for âcost-constrained mobilists,â consumers who need to get from point A to point B as cheaply as possible; âmobility innovation pioneers,â consumers who are willing to be the first to try out new disruptive mobility services; and âmicromobility enthusiasts,â consumers who use two-wheelers to get around in and out of town. We saw the aforementioned trends unfold differently across these groups.",
            "OEMs can expect the two-wheeler segment, which has dominated the Indian automotive sector for years, to intensify further: 31 percent of respondents expect to increase their use of private motorcycles and scooters, while 18 percent expect to use their micromobility vehicles (such as bicycles and e-scooters) more in the future. Not only do consumers expect to rely even more on two-wheelers, but for most, the next two-wheeler is electric: 86 percent of consumers would consider buying an electric two-wheeler, while only 69 percent would consider a combustion engine vehicle.",
            "When purchasing their next two-wheeler, Indian consumers are thinking most about vehicle brand, safety, and sustainability (Exhibit 1). Consumers continue to trust incumbents; however, theyâre also willing to embrace newcomer EV companies. This is evident from the fact that today, approximately more than 50 percent of the electricâtwo-wheeler market is dominated by new attackers. This is in significant contrast to the internal-combustion engine two-wheeler market, where incumbents continued to dominate more than 90 percent of the market over the past several decades.",
            "Some of these criteria align closely with our research on four-wheeler EVs , which also showed battery life, battery safety, and charging speed within the top ten most important consumer criteria for the electrification of cars. Some of the same concerns are relevant for electric two-wheelers, as well. Concerns about battery life reflect overall concerns about charging-infrastructure readiness: 35 percent of consumers feel that their area lacks a sufficient charging-infrastructure network. This perceived lack of infrastructure is important given that more than half of consumers (58 percent) feel the need for public charging. Hence, better penetration of public chargers, along with adequate safety protocols, could be pivotal to fast-track this journey.",
            "Moreover, our research shows that many Indian customers are ready to perform most of their vehicle purchase journeyâfrom searching to scheduling deliveryâwith the convenience of their smartphones or laptops via OEM-led apps or websites. For instance, more than 85 percent of consumers are starting their journey online, and about 50 percent are willing to purchase vehicles online (Exhibit 2). About 70 percent of consumers have started valuing the convenience of at-home delivery, at-home test-drives, and on-demand service. And while consumers are willing to go online, more than 80 percent of them still share the continued need for a physical touchpoint, cementing the role of channel partners and leading to emerging omnichannel solutions.",
            "As such, newer business models such as hybrid direct-to-consumer are starting to emerge in India. These models provide OEMs the opportunity to own the customer experience while existing channel partners continue to play a pivotal offline (though digitally integrated) role. However, these shifts mean that both OEMs and dealers need to significantly expand their capabilities to provide consumers a seamless experience. They also need to clearly demarcate their roles and responsibilities in the overall consumer purchase and postpurchase journey.",
            "The demand for flexible access will continue to increase as preferred ownership shifts from outright purchasing to financing, leasing, subscription, pay-per-use, and other models. For their next two-wheeler, 78 percent of consumers would currently opt for outright purchase. However, in the next ten years, that number drops to 63 percent (Exhibit 3). Indeed, alternative ownership forms such as financing, subscription, and leasing are on the riseâthough this trend is moving slower for electric two-wheelers than for standard EVs, potentially because of lower purchase cost.",
            "When consumers do think about purchasing an electric two-wheeler outright, most prefer premium âfunctionalâ features, such as higher speed and larger battery packâand they are willing to pay for those functional upgrades. Most consumers already purchase electric two-wheelers with a top speed of 80 kilometers (km) per hour (39 percent). Half of consumers would be willing to pay up to 10,000 rupees ($120) to upgrade their electric two-wheeler to a higher speed (from 80 km per hour to 100 km per hour).",
            "Range is also important for electric two-wheeler customers, and the majority prefer the largest battery pack. Ninety percent of purchasers would opt for more than 80 km per charge. In fact, nearly half (45 percent) would be willing to pay up to 10,000 rupees to upgrade from a range of 100 km to a range of 120 km.",
            "Thereâs no doubt that Indian consumersâ interest in electric two-wheelers is rising. And this interest comes with clear and shifting preferences regarding features, ownership options, and evolving purchase journeys. Manufacturers of electric two-wheelers will want to keep these shifting expectations and preferences in mind to capitalize on the market dynamics resulting from electrification in the years to come.",

            "Primed to enhance the car experience for drivers and passengers, OEMs and other mobility stakeholders want to understand consumer preferences and use cases for connectivity and digital services. The McKinsey Mobility Consumer Pulse Survey, which regularly asks mobility users about their perceptions and preferences for connectivity solutions and digital in-car offerings, may provide them with important, region-specific insights that can guide their next steps (see sidebar, âSurvey details,â for more information about the methodology). This article reviews the most recent survey data (from December 2022), the need for smartphone integration, preferred services and payment options, data-privacy concerns, and regional trends.",
            "In our survey, half of car owners say they want to use connectivity solutions and that in-car digital   offers more in the future. Across locations, electric-vehicle (EV) buyers are most open to these services, with   about 69 percent planning to increase their use of connectivity solutions, compared with 47 percent of buyers who intend to purchase traditional cars.",

            "Despite this interest, the survey also reveals some areas for concern. Only 17 percent of all consumers say they are satisfied with their existing connectivity offers, which could potentially depress demand. These findings suggest that OEMs could benefit from continuing to refine their connectivity offerings and from identifying the features and services that consumers most value and use.",
            "Many consumers immediately compare the built-in services that OEMs include in their vehicles to those available through their smartphones. This tendency is important, since most OEMs  include smartphone projection interfaces, such as Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, in their basic feature packages. When asked about system preferences, our survey revealed that:",
            "Consumers consider driving-convenience features and productivity amenities, such as intelligent parking-spot finders, in-car payment, and vehicle Wi-Fi hot spots, to be among the most important connectivity and digital offerings. Regular usageâbasically, how relevant these features are to a driverâs daily routineâappear to be linked to value ratings. If an in-car connectivity service is also standard on smartphones, consumers may be less willing to pay for it.",
            "In our survey, 30 percent of respondents say that they find individualized connectivity features, such as in-car personal assistants, to be valuable.",
            "In our survey, 30 percent of respondents say that they find individualized connectivity features, such as in-car personal assistants, to be valuable. At present, however, in-car entertainment use cases and gaming solutions only attract a small subset of customers, and these services received mediocre value ratings in our survey (Exhibit 1). The expected growth of autonomous cars, which would allow drivers to take their attention from the road, could widen the appeal of in-car gaming and entertainment. The growth of EVs could have a similar effect, since it would increase the amount of idle time that people spend in cars as their vehicles are charged. Current EV owners, who are already spending time at charging stations, are twice as likely as traditional car owners to consider entertainment and gaming offers to be valuable.",
            "Our survey also indicates that consumers may place value on predictive-maintenance offers. Automated notifications about the need for upcoming maintenance and repairs could help them keep their vehicles in shape and avoid potential problems.",
            "The survey also revealed that EV and internal combustion engine (ICE) buyers sometimes differ when considering the relevance of certain vehicle features (Exhibit 2). For instance,  EV buyers assign high relevance to having an unlimited in-car mobile data plan, placing it among the top eight individual connectivity features out of 21 features tested. ICE buyers considered this feature slightly less relevant.",
            "Most consumers want flexible access to connectivity features, with less than a third of survey respondents stating that they would prefer to lock themselves in by paying a one-time fee as part of the vehicle configuration. Within the subgroup of EV buyers, 43 percent prefer the flexibility of subscription services for in-car connectivity digital solutions (24 percent want monthly fees, and 19 percent are ready to commit annually for small discount) (Exhibit 3).",
            "Overall, about 80 percent of consumers want to select their initial connectivity services before or at the time of vehicle handover, allowing them immediate access.",
            "Among EV buyers, 40 percent show interest in usage-based insurance products, such as pay-as-you-drive programs for which the insurance tariff depends on driving patterns. In addition, 47 percent of EV buyers are interested in  unlocking features on demand, such as advanced driver assistance systems, for a permanent or temporary fee, even after the point of purchase.",

            " likely to be willing to share their data than owners of traditional cars. When asked about the organizations they trusted with their mobility-related data, consumers say they are most likely to cite their vehicle OEM, followed by independent certified third-party data-management authorities and insurance providers. One out of three car owners indicate that they would be more likely to share their car-related data if their vehicle manufacturer offered simple opt-in processes.",
            "As more data become available, new opportunities will emerge to monetize the data. OEMs should be careful to protect consumer privacy when pursuing them, however, or they may trigger some concerns.",
            "Our survey also provides insights about regional variations. For instance, connectivity offerings are four times more important during the car purchase process in China compared with other leading car markets. Overall, 54 percent of Chinese car buyers are open to switching their car brand for a better digital car experience; in Germany and the United States, less than 40 percent would consider this move (Exhibit 4). Whatâs more, about twice as many Chinese consumers find connectivity features valuable, compared with their European and American counterparts.",
            "These findings are in line with long-standing patterns. Chinese consumers have led the way in adoption of in-car digital services and are more attuned to in-car connectivity offers, and   the local car models available are testament to that. Given their expectations for connectivity, they may have a higher bar for the connectivity services expected in a base vehicle configuration.",
            "As OEMs consider what connectivity and in-car digital services belong in vehicles, they will benefit from taking a consumer view. What features are most valuable and relevant to current drivers? And will it ever be possible to compete if the same offerings are available on smartphones? Going even deeper, itâs important to consider how consumers will want to pay for these services, as well as the countries where uptake might be more rapid and widespread. As connectivity features advance and their market value grows, answering these questions will become even more important.",

        "title": "A road map for Europe’s automotive industry",
        "description": "Keeping Europe’s automotive industry competitive requires not just a refined focus on existing strengths but also an acceleration of existing efforts.",
        "paragraphs": [
            "The automotive industry is a jewel of the European economy. For decades, the industry has been an important contributor to Europeâs economic growth, innovation, and prosperity, accounting for almost 7 percent of the regionâs GDP and being directly or indirectly responsible for employing almost 14 million people.",
            " The industry also carries significant symbolic weight; taglines such as âMade in Germany,â âItalian car design,â âEuro NCAP for Saver Cars,â and âBritish racingâ have come to stand for European innovation and craftsmanship.",
            "However, the status quo is being challenged and the industry faces massive ongoing transformations, such as the shift from internal combustion engines to electrified powertrains and a shift in focus from hardware to differentiation through software. This dynamic has allowed new entrants in Europe and abroadâespecially in China, the largest automotive market in the world",
            "âto disrupt the market and win market share. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports for the first time, with exports of about 3.0 million vehicles, in contrast to Germanyâs 2.6 million.",
            " These transformative forces overlap with a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, including rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. All of these factors have greatly affected the European auto industry and make navigating the sectorâs transformation challenging. A prosperous future for the European automotive industry will therefore depend on how well and quickly it responds and how European stakeholders can shape the necessary conditions for future success. The need for action is urgent.",
            "To that end, we have sketched a road map that covers seven areas. Executing on this plan will require action from a variety of industry stakeholders. Speedy action from automotive companies will be important, but the regional ecosystem, including the public sector and multiple adjacent sectors, will need to participate in shaping a level playing field and a fertile environment for the future of the European automotive industry.",
            "The European automotive industry has been an engine powering prosperity and growth, employment, and innovation and has contributed to Europeâs image and perception on the global stage (Exhibit 1).",
            "An economic powerhouse for the region, the automotive industry contributed about 10 percent of Europeâs exports in 2022.",
            " The sectorâs more than 17,300 companies form a network of OEMs and suppliers of all tiers.",
            " Significantly, the industry directly or indirectly employs more than 6 percent of the regionâs workforce,",
            " creating positive spillover effects outside the sector.",
            "The automotive industry has also been a nexus of innovation. Technical champions and small and medium-size businesses within the ecosystem have continuously innovated, especially in the areas of combustion engine powertrain, chassis, safety systems, and exterior and interior design. Indeed, about 30 percent of global automotive patents originated from European countries, the most of any region.",
            " Significant investments into research and development have helped European automakers introduce new technologies that have contributed to major advances in sustainability and safety by improving fuel economies and reducing emissions, noise, and accidents.",
            "Progress and investment in the European auto industry over the past several decades have contributed to Europeâs global image. German engineering is widely touted,",
            " and our research suggests many European automakers are considered front-runners in sustainability, with some of the most ambitious targets around electric vehicles (EVs), decarbonization, and safety.",
            "Thanks in part to this work, the brand value of the ten largest European auto companies is conservatively estimated at a combined â¬200 billion; five of the ten most valuable car brands worldwide are European.",
            " The grand challenge now is to maintain and build on these assets in the face of profound and accelerating change.",
            "The historic strengths and recently reported record margins of European OEMs may create a false sense of safety for the industry. Accelerated disruptions around electrification, software, and new competitive pressures loom.",
            "Substantial market disruptions have been observed in other industries, with serious outcomes. For instance, European manufacturers lost more than 90 percent of their share of the smartphone market in just six years.",
            " McKinsey analysis shows that leading players in the film camera industry lost similar market share over nine years.",
            "Market share data suggest that European OEMsâ leadership position is being challenged as new entrants, especially from China, gain traction. Our analysis also suggests that European market conditions for local development and production are becoming less competitive. Analysis from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility shows that since 2019, European incumbents have lost six percentage points of market share in their home market and five percentage points in China. Meanwhile, Chinese OEMs are gaining ground in both China and Europe, reaching 45 percent market share in their home market in 2022 and octupling their market share in Europe between 2020 and 2022.",
            " This dynamic is even more apparent in battery electric vehicles (BEVs): new EV-focused entrants hold 51 percent of the global BEV market (Exhibit 2).",
            " Besides market share, European OEMs also face the challenge of running profitable BEV businesses.",
            "A more detailed look at different segments offers a more nuanced picture of the industry. In the premium segmentâhome turf for many European OEMsâEuropean OEMs still hold 71 percent of global sales. But this segment is also becoming more challenging to hold: newcomers claimed 18 percent of the premium market in 2022.",
            "This shake-up stems from the fast pace of change in the industry. The transition from internal-combustion-engine (ICE) to zero-emissions vehicles is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80 percent per year since 2020. McKinsey analysis suggests that many global mobility markets will reach near-total EV penetration by the mid-2030s. In response, European OEMs have announced ambitious electrification plans to launch more than 150 EV models through 2030, according to McKinsey analysis.",
            "The EV transition drives the industryâs emphasis away from hardware toward software and digital. According to our analysis, EV consumers are more than twice as likely to switch brands for better in-vehicle technology, such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) features and connectivity services. Our research shows that successful automakers are developing cars defined by software, resulting in a tripling of software content per vehicle since 2015.",
            "With electrified, software-defined cars becoming the norm, semiconductors and batteries are the new industry control points. In fact, more than a third of the value of a BEV is associated with the battery. Consequently, the European supplier landscape is changing rapidly, and new capabilities are needed in development and manufacturing.",
            "Recently, software development and hardware development are increasingly decoupling. Weâve observed that European suppliers have become proficient at the interaction between software and hardware in the context of specific control units that oversee specific components of a car, such as the engine or transmission. Modern vehicles may have as many as 150 control units in a distributed software architecture. Hardware and software will increasingly decouple as software becomes more centralized into domains such as the powertrain and in-vehicle connectivityâand, eventually, into computers that oversee zones of the vehicle rather than components.",
            "As a result of this shift toward more centralized computing, portions of vehicles may become commoditized, and scale and incremental improvements may become the main drivers of competitiveness. As a result, several component markets increasingly resemble the smartphone industry, in which the core differentiator is software innovationâin addition to economies of scale, industrial excellence, and quality in hardware. McKinsey analysis suggests that the number of build-to-print suppliers (which manufacture products and components to customersâ detailed engineering instructions) in the automotive industry that provide components such as power electronics will increase. Weâve found that about a third of OEMsâ requests for quotes in some powertrain components and systems are already build-to-print requests.",
            "New entrants are moving to supply the automotive market with critical future technologies such as batteries, semiconductors, and software. Traditional suppliers find themselves sandwiched between âhigh-tech commodityâ companies that provide semiconductors and batteries upstream and cost-pressured incumbent OEMs downstream. This dynamic threatens European supply chains. Consider that the current battery value chain is largely controlled by Chinese companies (Exhibit 3).",
            "To counteract these developments and form a strong supply network like the one Europe created during the ICE era, major industry participants are announcing strategic partnerships to secure access to resources and manufacturing capacity, especially for batteries and semiconductors. For example, some incumbents plan to strengthen their control over critical portions of the value chain by partnering with mine operators or even acquiring stakes in mines.",
            " While these actions are steps in the right direction, the projected supply and capacity are not yet enough to meet the regionâs forecast demand by 2030. Accelerated efforts are necessary.",
            "In a perfect storm for the European auto industry, the current macroeconomic climate is turbulent, with multiple ongoing crises. Compared with other regions, Europe is particularly exposed and affected, and the automotive sector is at a disadvantage compared with other important industries. These challenges fall into five major areas:",
            " Wholesale electricity costs in Europe have surged to twice the costs in the United States and triple costs in China.",
            " This creates challenges for the auto industry, in which a significant portion of production costs come from energy requirements.",
            " The European auto industry generates a significantâand higher compared with other regionsâshare of its revenues through exports,",
            " which means current geopolitical pressures have an outsize impact on European automakers.",
            " Compared with other industries, the auto industry relies more heavily on timely deliveries of parts and components from international markets. The European auto industry is therefore at considerable risk when finely tuned international supply chains are disrupted.",
            " Inflation has hit Europe much more severely than the United States or China, with labor costs for European automakers disproportionately affected compared with other industries.",
            " Europeâs productivity and economic growth lag behind those of its peers, particularly in areas such as software engineering in which the auto industry needs significant additional capacity.",
            "Finally, these transformative forces overlap with a European macroeconomic environment that has a particularly acute impact on the regionâs auto industry (see sidebar âMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industryâ).",
            "The European auto industry is in the midst of the greatest change in its history. In service of helping the industry remain globally competitive we outline a road map of seven pillars for stakeholders to act on (Exhibit 4). The time to act is now: according to our analysis, European automotive OEMs and suppliers earn about three times the revenue of their Chinese counterparts and five times the EBIT, which means the European industry can act from a position of strength.",
            "A rapid response from OEMs and suppliers in the European auto industry will be important. But other stakeholdersâincluding adjacent industries such as the energy, research, and public sectorsâwould also need to act collaboratively to provide an environment that enables success for the European automotive industry (and mobility ecosystem) of the future. In short, the ecosystem approach that made Europe strong in the ICE era has to be translated to serve the era of software-defined, electrified cars.",
            "The European automotive industry will need to extend its legacy of cutting-edge product design and superior brand value and transfer it into the new context of software-defined electric vehicles.",
            "Of the 25 global brands with the highest brand value, all but three are European.",
            " Our data show that brand remains among the top five purchase criteria for European, American, and Chinese auto consumers. However, in the age of electrification and software-defined cars, purchase criteria will change and brand rankings might get reshuffled.",
            "To maintain superior brand value, European incumbent OEMs would need to analyze and understand customer needs and preferences to build desirable products. Traditional consumer segmentation would need to be adapted for the era of software-defined electric vehicles, with more-detailed consumer profiles and more-granular user profiles. Owning and analyzing consumer data will enable OEMs to offer tailored mobility solutions and seamlessly engage consumers across the life cycle. They can also build their product development organizations to reflect customer journeys and experiences, which would bring operational roles closer to the customer. As consumersâ desires change and technology advances, OEMs would need to continuously update their software remotely to bring the most up-to-date functionality to customers and meet their needs.",
            "McKinsey research from 2022 shows that the vehicle purchase price is the most important buying factor for consumers across markets.",
            " Particularly in EVs, Chinese OEMs can turn their cost advantage into a competitive edge: our analysis shows that their costs are 20 to 30 percent lower than those of European OEMs.",
            "To catch up, European OEMs could drive down costs strategically. According to our analysis, European OEMs could close up to 20 percentage points of the cost gap by adopting structural product design, vertically integrating battery production, scaling EV production, and improving productivity. For example, battery insourcing could decrease European OEMsâ costs by three percentage points, and cost-efficient battery cell chemistry alternatives could save five to six percentage points for some vehicles and segments. As for the remaining 5 to 10 percentage-point cost gap, European OEMs could identify differentiating features that consumers would be willing to pay a premium for, such as brand differentiation; environmental, social, and governance (ESG) leadership; and superior safety performance.",
            "Speed is another consideration. McKinsey analysis shows that European OEMs have a long development cycle compared with competitors from other regions, with concept-to-pilot phases lasting up to four years. By contrast, weâve found that the fastest automakers in China need only 21 months to move from concept to pilot, allowing them to respond to market trends much more quickly.",
            "To be clear, itâs not necessarily appropriate to make direct comparisons between the Chinese and European automotive sectors or development cycles. However, European OEMs should take on the challenge and redesign their own processes to accelerate innovation, development, and industrialization. For instance, the product design process could be accelerated through iterative styling methods. Subsequent product development could be optimized by decoupling hardware and software development and by applying agile principles to software development. Across all processes, co-locating cross-domain teams and setting up task forces for products that are behind schedule or components with supply bottlenecks can further accelerate development.",
            "Our research shows China will remain the biggest automotive market in the future, which means winning in China will be important for European OEMs and suppliers that want to play a globally relevant role.",
            "European incumbents have lost five percentage points of market share in China since 2019, a substantial decrease. Meanwhile, our analysis shows that Chinese automakers are outpacing their competitors and have gained more than ten percentage points of market share in China, driven by their hold on more than 80 percent of the EV market.",
            "How have they done it? Chinese OEMs offer significantly lower price points, and their products are more appealing and tailored to Chinese consumersâ needs and preferences. They also bring targeted innovations to market rapidly; our research shows that more than 70 percent of new vehicles unveiled at the Shanghai auto show in April 2023 came from Chinese OEMs.",
            "Like their OEM counterparts, European automotive suppliers have a hard time gaining traction with Chinese EV players, especially for EV powertrain components and systems. While Western suppliers have held more than half of Chinaâs ICE powertrain market, they hold less than 5 percent of the EV powertrain market.",
            "European OEMs and suppliers would need a fundamental strategic overhaul to regain competitiveness in China and meet the preferences of Chinese customers. This starts with developing products specifically tailored for the Chinese market. According to our research, the average customer in China is 34 years old, compared with 58 in Europe. These consumers have significantly different purchasing criteria. For instance, Chinese consumers place higher value on cutting-edge technology, connectivity, advanced driver assistance systems, and on-board multimedia screens than European and American consumers do. Chinese car buyers also favor simplified vehicle choices with preconfigured options.",
            "To implement a âlocal for localâ strategyâin which R&D, production, and distribution are in close proximity to where products will be bought and usedâEuropean players would need to adjust their operating models for the Chinese market. For example, OEMs could localize research and development capabilities and transfer decision rights to local management. Entering local partnerships across the portfolio and supply chain will also be essential to develop a strong foothold in China and to benefit from the know-how and reputations of local partners.",
            "To reduce bottlenecks and dependencies, the industry will need resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains centered on batteries, semiconductors, and green materials. In 2021, the chip crisis led to a loss of ten million vehicles in global production,",
            " highlighting a need to increase supply chain resilience.",
            "To create resilient supply, localization is vital. We project that the European supplyâdemand gap for batteries will reach almost 40 percent, or 500 gigawatt-hours (GWh), by 2030. To cover European battery demand locally, an additional 20 gigafactories, a â¬35 billion investment, would be needed.",
            " The continent would also need 37 new semiconductor fabs to cover local demand, requiring a â¬190 billion investment.",
            " As a first step, the European Chips Act will provide â¬43 billion in subsidies. Next steps could involve expanding the ecosystem along the value chain while safeguarding crucial supplies, with tactics such as increasing safety stock and implementing dual-sourcing strategies.",
            "At least in the midterm, improving the circularity of supply chains will further decrease Europeâs dependence on raw materials and components from other regions while increasing sustainability. It could also increase the share of local added value in critical EV components and create additional jobs and economic growth. Our analysis shows that reusing materials from scrapped batteries can also save up to 10 percent of costs and avoid 20 percent of the CO",
            " required in production. To implement a circular value chain, industry stakeholders would need to commit to the use of recycled content and material efficiency and establish reverse operations at end of life.",
            "End-to-end transparency on ESG criteria such as digital traceability is an important way to make critical supply chains more sustainable. As sustainability standards in key industries begin to developâconsider the launch of the battery passport, which contains ESG data for batteries",
            "âthe European auto industry should stay at the forefront of ESG performance to gain and maintain competitive advantage in the future.",
            "Weâve observed that European players are underrepresented in battery manufacturing and high-end compute and semiconductors that power artificial intelligence. According to our analysis, only one European manufacturer is among the top ten in terms of market capitalization for battery manufacturing, while in semiconductors, Europe needs to close the capability gap for the next wave of computing to deliver functionalities such as ADAS.",
            "A path to creating an ecosystem of technology champions consists of three elements. First, Europe should consider developing a pan-European regulatory rule book to scale high-growth firms, aligning tax standards, regulations, labor rules, and bureaucratic processes. Second, to stay at the forefront of technology, the region would need to build specialized knowledge and product innovation capabilities. Suppliers could tap into niche specialties, such as more-sustainable battery refining. Finally, the European industry would need a battery and semiconductor network, similar to the one that serves the aerospace industry. European incumbents could form strategic partnerships with emerging entrants and research institutions.",
            "Advanced driver assistance systems features are increasingly important. They are becoming a key differentiator for vehicle buyers: According to our research, 51 percent of consumers worldwide would consider switching to some form of ADAS car in the future. Competitive pressures around ADAS are also intensifying. In 2022, Mercedes-Benz was the first automotive player to introduce and certify Level 3 autonomy, the threshold at which drivers can take their hands off the wheel.",
            " Other participants in the global industry are catching up using a variety of technology approaches.",
            "To remain competitive, the European industry may need to form a cross-industry alliance. Players could collaborate in two main areas. The first area is where differentiation is negligible and where there are opportunities for savings. This would include standardizing sensor communication protocols, which would simplify the integration of new sensors. Standardizing middleware (which sits between front- and back-end technologies) and layers of the operating system are other approaches.",
            "The second area of collaboration is where scale and large databases could enable a faster, more robust development process for efforts including the continuous updates of software layers in mapsâupdates such as creating high-definition map- and location-based services. A shared pool of data could also be used for AI training and validation.",
            "The right regulatory environment could be critical to enable this kind of cross-industry collaboration. Public-sector stakeholders could consider adapting existing guidelines to the context of autonomous driving. These updates could encourage collaborative precompetitive research and innovation that advance and accelerate technological progress and drive standardization.",
            "Software is essential to the future of the automotive industry. But according to our analysis, only 15 to 20 percent of current R&D workers at European incumbents have software skills, compared with almost 45 percent at new entrants.",
            "To shrink the gap, industry stakeholders would need to find holistic solutions. For example, European incumbents could create sharedâor at least interoperableâsoftware platforms across OEMs in Europe (and possibly other regions where the industry has strong partnerships) to complement individual participantsâ capabilities and to avoid costly solo efforts.",
            "Early hiring, reskilling, and foreign talent can also help close the gap. Players can intensify early hiring directly from universities and boost STEM and software talent education through partnerships with universities and schools. Our research shows that reskilling is already in progress: 37 percent of European suppliers have ongoing reskilling efforts, and another 41 percent have plans to implement them. To draw skilled software talent from other regions, European employers would need accelerate processes around work permits and accommodate foreign talentâs requirements on salary, benefits, and working conditions.",
            "These insights were developed by the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM). Since 2011, the MCFM has worked with stakeholders across the mobility ecosystem by providing independent and integrated evidence about possible future-mobility scenarios. With our unique, bottom-up modeling approach, our insights enable an end-to-end analytics journey through the future of mobilityâfrom consumer needs to modal mix across urban/rural areas, sales, value pools, and life cycle sustainability. ",

            "European automotive players are moving in the right direction but should consider scaling and accelerating their efforts. To accomplish this, a wide variety of stakeholders in the region would need to create an environment that breeds progress and future wins for the regionâs automotive industry. The formula requires a road map, catalysts, and platforms for cooperation.",
            "A clear road map such as the one we outline is needed to help accelerate the European automotive industryâs progress. Its seven pillars would need to be converted into actionable measures and quantifiable targets for industry stakeholdersâsuppliers, OEMs, players from adjacent industries, and regulatory bodies. Associations could take on a coordinating role.",
            "Catalysts play a significant role in implementing the road map. One is a competitive regulatory environment. Clearly defining and communicating common standards and codifying interoperability across all elements of the road map is likely to be critical.",
            "Another critical catalyst of the European industryâs transition is EV infrastructure. According to our analysis, the industry will need a cumulative â¬300 billion worth of infrastructure investments in electricity generation, the electricity grid, EV chargers, and hydrogen refueling systems through 2030.",
            " European stakeholders have begun to install public chargers at a pace of 2,000 charging points per week.",
            " But to meet demand, decision makers would need to build out charging infrastructure to the tune of 6,000 to 14,000 charging points per week.",
            " We found that the wind and solar assets required to fulfill the corresponding demand for energy with renewable sources would require four times as many workers in Europe by 2030 than are currently available.",
            "Finally, the industry would need platforms for collaboration. As industry boundaries are redefined, three kinds of partnership will become more important: horizontal partnerships between entities in the same parts of the value chain (such as multiple car companies) for efforts such as software development or to gain a solid footing in the Chinese market; vertical partnerships between entities in different parts of the value chain (such as car companies with tech companies) to secure access to technology and talent; and cross-industry partnerships, such as collaborations between automotive players and utilities to facilitate structural goals such as seamless sector coupling.",
            "Our road map shows a way forward for a globally competitive European auto industry. The work will require action from an expansive array of regional stakeholders and a supportive administrative environment. Time is of the essence.",

            "The shifts in technology and consumer preferences will eventually result in a mobility ecosystem that is fully connected, intelligent, and environmentally friendly. Vehicles could have software that allows them to scan their surroundings to find parking spaces or identify hazards, perhaps paving the way to full autonomy. Passengers could have access to in-car gaming and video streaming. If a route is blocked, vehicles could propose alternatives. For more complicated trips, consumers may use applications to transfer seamlessly between subways, shared vehicles, and other transportation options.",
            "These changesâas well as many other connected-car features and mobility applicationsâdepend on the rapid and smooth exchange of vast amounts of data between in-vehicle computers and those in other locations. Similarly, many mobility applications, such as those for mapping, depend on the exchange of information between tech companies and OEMs. Many of these businesses have only recently begun to work together, and the partners are still experimenting with the best ways to share and exchange data.",
            " alive or inanimate, is composed of atoms and subatomic particles that interact in different ways governed by the principles of quantum mechanics. Some particles are in a pure stateâthey remain fixed and unchanged. Others are in a quantum stateâa concept that can be difficult to understand because it involves having a particle occupy multiple states simultaneously. For instance, an electron in a pure state spins up or down; in a quantum state, also referred to as superposition, it spins up and down simultaneously. Another quantum principle states that particles can be in a state of entanglement in which changes in one directly affect the other. The principles of superposition and entanglement are fundamental to quantum computing.",
            "Quantum bits, or qubits, are the smallest units of data that a quantum computer can process and store. In a pure state, qubits have a value of 1 or 0, similar to the bits used in computing today. In superposition, they can be both of these values simultaneously, and that enables parallel computations on a massive scale. While classical computers must conduct a new calculation any time a variable changes, quantum computers can explore a problem with many possible variables simultaneously.",
            "Existing computers, although sufficient for many applications, canât fully support all of the changes required to create a connected and intelligent-mobility ecosystem. Quantum computing (QC) could potentially provide faster and better solutions by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanicsâthe rules that govern how atoms and subatomic particles act and interact. (See sidebar, âPrinciples of quantum computing,â for more information.) Over the short term, QC may be most applicable to solving complex problems involving small datasets; as its performance improves, QC will be applied to extremely large datasets.",
            "Although researchers have estimated that ",
            "Â is about five to ten years away, some mobility companies are already piloting applications and building their capabilities in this area. Additional opportunities could soon emerge. For instance, OEMs could use QC to simulate how changing the material composition of a vehicle component would affect performance. QCâs benefits might be particularly helpful in large countries with multiple roads and many route alternatives. Within autonomous driving, QC may improve the performance of sensors and vehicle systems, allowing them to make instant decisions when confronted with an obstacle in the road, or help OEMs to develop better encryption algorithms to prevent hackers from taking over vehicles.",
            "If mobility players continue to scale their initiatives, QC could create significant value in areas ranging from vehicle design to last-mile delivery to long-distance shipping. Our analysis shows that automotive, along with chemical, financial services, and life sciences, is likely to experience the earliest economic impact from QC. In the automotive industry alone, for instance, the economic value of QC could range from ",
            ".",
            "The algorithms used in high-performance classical computing (HPC)âtodayâs standardâare sufficient for many computations, including those used to evaluate the results of clinical trials, analyze financial trends, and predict weather patterns. QC could handle the same computations much more rapidly, however, and with lower power requirements. QC might also solve some complex problems across industries that are now beyond the reach of HPC.",
            "Within the mobility sector, some companies have been hesitant to pursue QC applications because HPC costs less and is equally likely to solve most problems, albeit more slowly. But this mindset might be shortsighted, since QC algorithms are constantly improving and the associated costs may decrease. Across industries, QC is most likely to gain traction for the three following activities because it offers the greatest time and cost advantages over HPC, as well as better accuracy in some instances (Exhibit 1):",
            "In the near term, companies may generate the most impact by relying on a hybrid operating model in which they apply HPC to some problems and reserve QC for select cases where it offers the greatest benefits. Consider chemical interactions. Since quantum mechanics govern how atoms and subatomic particles interact, QC could model this intrinsically quantum process with much less memory and processing power than that required by HPC.",
            "QC can promote improvement along the entire mobility value chain (Exhibit 2). Within manufacturing, for instance, OEMs can use QC to optimize the creation of digital twins, which are virtual representations of factories that can help companies optimize robot paths within warehouses, schedule jobs, place equipment, enhance quality control, or improve energy usage. A leading global automotive supplier  has entered a partnership with a QC company to build digital twins that will provide greater insight into equipment performance and production processes while potentially reducing waste and energy use.",
            "Some of the most important QC use cases involve engineering R&D and product design. Consider battery technology: almost all EV batteries now contain lithium, often in combination with other chemicals, and manufacturers are investigating other options. QC could improve the algorithms for analyzing molecular structure and interactions, allowing manufacturers to create lighter, safer, and more cost-effective batteries.",
            "OEMs have already formed partnerships with QC companies to accelerate battery development. Some companies are starting to create QC algorithms that use density functional theory to analyze the electronic structures of different materials much more rapidly and accurately than is possible with HPC. Beyond battery development, OEMs could use QC to gain more detailed and rapid insights about chemical properties and reactions during the development of green fuels or heat-resistant materials.",
            "QC could also transform multiple areas of vehicle, aircraft, and satellite design, allowing OEMs to optimize product weight, sensor positioning, and resistance to physical stress. It could also improve computational fluid dynamics testing. These efforts could potentially costly build-test-improve cycles for metal-forming processes because QC can provide insights more rapidly than HPC. Again, multiple OEMs are off to an early start by working with QC companies on design issues to leverage quantum processors and tailored simulation algorithms to predict how any process modifications could alter the composition of vehicle parts and determine whether the changes would make the components noncompliant with regulations. In addition to expediting development cycles and increasing safety, the virtual modeling could help OEMs produce lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles.",
            "QC could potentially benefit all players in the mobility ecosystem, including fleet providers and the start-ups that are trying to disrupt transportation.",
            " QC algorithms can optimize fleet management, resulting in more efficient operations, reduced costs, and ",
            ". Some trucking fleets now use QC to analyze the effect of multiple variables, including road construction, when planning routes and dispatching drivers. Within maritime, a leading global oil and gas company is working on a QC initiative that involves modeling the comparative advantages of different shipping routes to increase the rate of just-in-time energy delivery. A global OEM has signed a deal to use NASAâs quantum computer in its autonomous-car research and hopes to plot the most efficient routes for diesel commercial truck fleets within regions that contain multiple cities.",
            " Road congestion is an increasing problem in many countries, and Volkswagen, in combination with D-Wave Systems, has attempted to develop traffic flow optimization algorithms. In one project, it analyzed data from public taxis in Beijing to determine the best routes between the city center and the airport. Volkswagen then created a mobile app that can provide the best route to any destination. In Lisbon, Volkswagen equipped public buses with a system that uses QC to calculate the fastest route in near real time.",
            " Many aviation companies have set ambitious sustainability targets because air traffic is responsible for a high percentage of global emissions. They are also trying to reduce supply chain bottlenecks, which have become more common since the pandemic, by streamlining processes and reducing transit time. QC can help in both areas. For instance, a leading global aerospace company is working on QC algorithms that increase loading efficiency and optimize cargo distribution on flightsâimprovements that could reduce both time and costs. These algorithms consider multiple variables that affect payload capacity, including the aircraftâs center of gravity and fuselage shear limits.",
            "Advanced air mobility involves the flight of next-generation concepts, including passenger drones. One organization, the Quantum Transformation Project, is already attempting to optimize flight routes and scheduling for these aircraft by using QC to assess numerous factors in combination, including constantly changing weather conditions.",
            "By processing vast amounts of data from sensors and monitoring systems, quantum algorithms can detect anomalies and predict maintenance requirements before critical failures occur. This proactive approach can improve safety, reduce downtime, and enhance overall operational efficiency.",
            "Compared with other innovative technologies, investment in QC is still relatively low. It has steadily grown in recent years, however, primarily because various governments have directed large amounts of public funding to it. The QC ",
            ", compared with $5 billion for generative AI and $16 billion for immersive-reality technologies.",
            " Companies clearly recognize QCâs potential value, however, and are considering possible QC applications. As they explore the potential cost and speed advantages, they should consider the following factors:",
            "For those companies that want to accelerate their QC efforts, three activities may help. First, technology monitoring and capability building are essential. Companies could build dedicated teams to track the latest QC developments, including those related to hardware, hybrid integration, coding platforms, and postquantum cryptography protocols. In addition to accelerating progress, the presence of a QC-focused group may signal this technologyâs importance to the entire organization.",
            "The next activity is both practical and basic: use case identification. Over the next three to five years, companies may focus their attention on projects involving noisy intermediate-scale quantum. The computers involved will have between 50 and a few hundred qubits, and their performance may surpass HPC in many instances, but the ânoiseâ in the quantum gates will limit the number of sequential calculations that can be performed before errors arise. Over the longer term, companies may benefit from fault-tolerant QC, which could emerge before the end of the decade. This type of computing minimizes the errors that can occur when qubits interact.",
            "The last key activity is one familiar to many OEMs: collaborating at scale with QC companies and academic institutions. Active participation in such partnerships may help ensure that some QC research focuses on areas that are critical to mobility, and it may help increase the talent pipeline for those companies that want to bring QC skills in-house.",
            "As the mobility sector undergoes changes not seen for decades, QC could be essential to achieving an intelligent, connected ecosystem that relies on the swift exchange and processing of massive amounts of data. While the journey to capture QCâs full potential may seem long and protracted, the technology could potentially shave years off the development timelines for autonomous vehicles and other innovations that might otherwise never materialize or else take decades to achieve.",

        "description": "The market for battery energy storage systems is growing rapidly. Here are the key questions for those who want to lead the way.",
        "paragraphs": [
            "of Paris Agreement goals rapidly approaching, governments and organizations everywhere are looking to increase the adoption of renewable-energy sources. Some of the regions with the heaviest use of energy have extra incentives for pursuing alternatives to traditional energy. In Europe, the incentive stems from an energy crisis. In the United States, it comes courtesy of the Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 law that allocates $370 billion to clean-energy investments.",
            "These developments are propelling the market for battery energy storage systems (BESS). Battery storage is an essential enabler of renewable-energy generation, helping alternatives make a steady contribution to the worldâs energy needs despite the inherently intermittent character of the underlying sources. The flexibility BESS provides will make it integral to applications such as peak shaving, self-consumption optimization, and backup power in the event of outages. Those applications are starting to become more profitable as battery prices fall.",
            "All of this has created a significant opportunity. More than $5 billion was invested in BESS in 2022, according to our analysisâalmost a threefold increase from the previous year. We expect the global BESS market to reach between $120 billion and $150 billion by 2030, more than double its size today. But itâs still a fragmented market, with many providers wondering where and how to compete. Now is the time to figure out where the best opportunities will be in the rapidly accelerating BESS market and to start preparing for them.",
            "Here are some questionsâand answersâto help BESS players formulate their strategies.",
            "The best way to get a sense of the opportunities associated with BESS is to segment the market by the applications and sizes of users. There are three segments in BESS: front-of-the-meter (FTM) utility-scale installations, which are typically larger than ten megawatt-hours (MWh); behind-the-meter (BTM) commercial and industrial installations, which typically range from 30 kilowatt-hours (kWh) to ten MWh; and BTM residential installations, which are usually less than 30 kWh (Exhibit 1).",
            "We expect utility-scale BESS, which already accounts for the bulk of new annual capacity, to grow around 29 percent per year for the rest of this decadeâthe fastest of the three segments. The 450 to 620 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in annual utility-scale installations forecast for 2030 would give utility-scale BESS a share of up to 90 percent of the total market in that year (Exhibit 2).",
            "Customers of FTM installations are primarily utilities, grid operators, and renewable developers looking to balance the intermittency of renewables, provide grid stability services, or defer costly investments to their grid. The BESS providers in this segment generally are vertically integrated battery producers or large system integrators. They will differentiate themselves on the basis of cost and scale, reliability, project management track record, and ability to develop energy management systems and software solutions for grid optimization and trading.",
            "BESS deployments are already happening on a very large scale. One US energy company is working on a BESS project that could eventually have a capacity of six GWh. Another US company, with business interests inside and outside of energy, has already surpassed that, having reached 6.5 GWh in BESS deployments in 2022. Much of the money pouring into BESS now is going toward services that increase energy providersâ flexibilityâfor instance, through firm frequency response. In the long run, BESS growth will stem more from the build-out of solar parks and wind farms, which will need batteries to handle their short-duration storage needs.",
            "Revenue models for FTM utility-scale BESS depend heavily on the dynamics of the regions that providers are entering. Most utility-scale BESS players pursue a strategy of revenue stacking, or assembling revenues from a variety of sources. They might participate in ancillary services, arbitrage, and capacity auctions. For instance, many BESS installations in the United Kingdom currently revolve around ancillary services such as frequency control. Italy has BESS players that have broken through by winning one of the countryâs renewables-focused capacity auctions. The opportunities in Germany revolve more around avoiding costly grid upgrades. The BESS players that have gotten traction in the FTM utility segment have understood the value of responding individually to countries and their regulations versus using one monolithic strategy.",
            "Commercial and industrial (C&I) is the second-largest segment, and the 13 percent CAGR we forecast for it should allow C&I to reach between 52 and 70 GWh in annual additions by 2030.",
            "C&I has four subsegments. The first is electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI). EVs will jump from about 23 percent of all global vehicle sales in 2025 to 45 percent in 2030, according to the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility. This growth will require rapid expansion of regular charging stations and super chargers, putting pressure on the current grid infrastructure and necessitating costly, time-consuming upgrades. To avoid this, charging station companies and owners may opt to put a BESS on their properties. Partnerships have already formed between BESS players and EV producers to build more EVCI, including in remote locations.",
            "The next subsegment of C&I is critical infrastructure such as telecommunication towers, data centers, and hospitals. In this subsegment, lead-acid batteries usually provide temporary backup through an uninterruptible power supply during outages until power resumes or diesel generators are turned on. In addition to replacing lead-acid batteries, lithium-ion BESS products can also be used to reduce reliance on less environmentally friendly diesel generators and can be integrated with renewable sources such as rooftop solar. In certain cases, excess energy stored on a battery may allow organizations to generate revenues through grid services. Several telecommunication players and data center owners are already switching to BESS as their uninterruptible power supply solution and for the additional benefits BESS provides.",
            "The third subsegment is public infrastructure, commercial buildings, and factories. This subsegment will mostly use energy storage systems to help with peak shaving, integration with on-site renewables, self-consumption optimization, backup applications, and the provision of grid services. We believe BESS has the potential to reduce energy costs in these areas by up to 80 percent. The argument for BESS is especially strong in places such as Germany, North America, and the United Kingdom, where demand charges are often applied.",
            "The final C&I subsegment consists of harsh environmentsâapplications for mining, construction, oil and gas exploration, and events such as outdoor festivals. The source of the growth will be customers moving away from diesel or gas generators in favor of low-emission solutions such as BESS and hybrid generators. A main factor driving adoption in this segment is upcoming regulations (including the European Commissionâs sustainability-focused Big Buyers initiative and Osloâs plan for net zero on construction sites by 2025). Many of the companies that make the switch will start by converting to hybrid genset solutions rather than immediately moving completely to BESS.",
            "Residential installationsâheaded for about 20 GWh in 2030ârepresent the smallest BESS segment. But residential is an attractive segment given the opportunity for innovation and differentiation in areas ranging from traditional home storage to the creation of microgrids in remote communities. From a sales perspective, BESS can be bundled with photovoltaic panels or integrated into smart homes or home EV charging systems. Tailored products will help residential customers achieve goals such as self-sufficiency, optimized self-consumption, and lower peak power consumptionâand they may mean higher margins in this sector. Our recent consumer survey on alternative energy purchases suggests that interest in a BESS product will come down to a few factors, starting with price, safety, and ease of installation (Exhibit 3).",
            "In a new market like this, itâs important to have a sense of the potential revenues and margins associated with the different products and services. The BESS value chain starts with manufacturers of storage components, including battery cells and packs, and of the inverters, housing, and other essential components in the balance of system. By our estimate, the providers in this part of the chain will receive roughly half of the BESS market profit pool.",
            "Then there are the system integration activities, including the overall design and development of energy management systems and other software to make BESS more flexible and useful. We expect these integrators to get another 25 to 30 percent of the available profit pool.",
            "Finally, between 10 and 20 percent of the profit pool is associated with sales entities, project development organizations, other customer acquisition activities, and commissioning (Exhibit 4).",
            "From a technology perspective, the main battery metrics that customers care about are cycle life and affordability. Lithium-ion batteries are currently dominant because they meet customersâ needs. Nickel manganese cobalt cathode used to be the primary battery chemistry, but lithium iron phosphate (LFP) has overtaken it as a cheaper option. (Lithium iron phosphate customers appear willing to accept the fact that LFP isnât as strong as a nickel battery in certain areas, such as energy density.) However, lithium is scarce, which has opened the door to a number of other interesting and promising battery technologies, especially cell-based options such as sodium-ion (Na-ion), sodium-sulfur (Na-S), metal-air, and flow batteries.",
            "Sodium-ion is one technology to watch. To be sure, sodium-ion batteries are still behind lithium-ion batteries in some important respects. Sodium-ion batteries have lower cycle life (2,000â4,000 versus 4,000â8,000 for lithium) and lower energy density (120â160 watt-hours per kilogram versus 170â190 watt-hours per kilogram for LFP). However, sodium-ion has the potential to be less costlyâup to 20 percent cheaper than LFP, according to our analysisâand the technology continues to improve, especially as manufacturing reaches scale. Another advantage is safety: sodium batteries are less prone to thermal runaway. Thereâs also a sustainability case for sodium-ion batteries, because the environmental impact of mining lithium is high.",
            "All of this makes it likely that sodium-ion batteries will capture an increasing share of the BESS market. Indeed, at least 6 manufacturers are expected to launch production of sodium-ion batteries in 2023. Clearly, providers will have to make decisions about which technology to bet on. Integrators may want to set up their systems so that their transition to sodium-ion batteries is straightforward as the batteries become widely available.",
            "This is a critical question given the many customer segments that are available, the different business models that exist, and the impending technology shifts. Here are four actions that may contribute to success in the market:",
            " In a nascent industry such as this, it pays for companies to think about other products and services that they could get into, whether through organic moves or inorganic ones. For instance, is there anything to stop a system integrator from doing battery packaging in-house? Or from codeveloping a new cell chemistry with a battery manufacturer? For that matter, is there anything to keep a battery manufacturer from adding system-integration or service capabilities to appeal to a specific BESS segment, such as utilities?",
            "Software is a particularly critical area to explore. The value of storage systems will likely evolve from just hardware into the software that controls and enhances the system, unlocking the opportunity to capture larger customer segments and higher margins. BESS players need to develop these capabilities early.",
            " Many critical BESS components (ranging from battery cells to semiconductors in inverters and control systems) rely on complex supply chains, which are susceptible to supply shocks from a multitude of sources, including raw material shortages and regulation changes. Strategic partnerships, multi-sourcing, and local sourcing are all levers to consider when defining a supply chain strategy, while not forgetting to plan for potential technology shifts. In addition to BESS components, another bottleneck for those in the market is engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) capability and capacity, particularly for front-of-the-meter applications. Strategic partnerships with large EPC players ready for large-scale BESS installations are crucial to ensure successful execution of BESS projects.",
            " Product specifications should reflect what customers care about. Having a customer segment strategy that informs the road map will increase the odds that every feature matters to customers. Such an approach is especially important given that price competition is likely to remain a permanent reality in the BESS market. The right product road map will also increase the odds of having a unique selling proposition in any segment a company happens to be in. For example, making the right decision on system architecture and integrating with existing customer infrastructure (say, by coupling direct current with photovoltaic technology) could reduce the barriers to entry for many customers.",
            " With BESS in the spotlight and revenues starting to increase rapidly, now is not a time to play it safe. While itâs true that the market is highly fragmented, itâs also true that some bigger players are starting to amass market share. This raises the stakes for all companies, especially for small ones that may have started a decade ago as research projects and now find themselves sitting on top of valuable intellectual property. These companies will likely need to take some risks to have a chance of gaining share and avoid being muscled out by bigger companies.",
            "The BESS market is in an explosive stage of development; players that donât move now will miss out. The winners in the market will be the companies that exhibit the four things required for success. These winners will create value in a new market as the energy transition accelerates.",

        "title": "Data and analytics in the driverâs seat of the used-car market",
        "description": "Companies across the used-car marketâs value chain can use data and analytics to tap into growth opportunities and improve margins.",
        "paragraphs": [
            "used-car market in the United States and Europe is projected to bring in nearly $1.2 trillion in revenue in 2023. Across both regions, this market is quite fragmented: the top 20 used-car retailers have less than 20 percent market share in America and less than 10 percent in Europe. Compared with other retail segments, this historic fragmentation has led to slow adoption of innovative digital and analytics capabilities across the value chain. It has also opened opportunities for digital-first entrants, elevating pressure on incumbents to innovate.",
            "Moreover, as used-car companies emerge from complicated market dynamics caused by the pandemic, they have been thrust into a new and complex environment, contending with changing consumer preferences, evolving supply-and-demand dynamics, and economic pressures. These influences will make it more difficult for players across the used-car ecosystem to grow and will increase pressure to maintain elevated margins from the pandemic period.",
            "To tap into customer demand, protect margins, and improve performance, companies across the used-car value chainânamely B2B and B2C dealers, OEMs, and financing and leasing companiesâmust reinvent and redesign business approaches to be more analytically savvy if they want to stay ahead of the competition.",
            "Geopolitical issues and supply chain challengesâspecifically the shortage of chips",
            " and other electronic componentsâhave hampered the supply of both new and used cars over the past several years. This state of strained supply and high demand have allowed for inflated pricing of new and used vehicles and higher margins on sales. Though supply is recovering for some models, demand is now under pressure because of purchasing power depressions driven by inflationary tendencies in many regions. Consequently, dealers are losing some of that pricing power: the average price of a used car in the United States increased by 25 percent between 2020 and its peak in 2022, but it has since fallen (Exhibit 1). Demand and supply are further affected by disruptions in fiscal policy in both markets: higher interest rates increase the cost of financing, which decreases auto finance companiesâ margins while also pricing some prospective consumers out of the market. This is especially the case with electric vehicles (EVs) because higher energy prices, the fear of unstable residual values, and the adjustment of subsidies in some markets are jeopardizing the promise of lower total costs of ownership that EVs have made to private retail customers.",
            "Meanwhile, customers continue to shift more of their car-purchasing journey online. According to McKinsey research, more than 95 percent of used-car searches start online with customers researching vehicle information, and more than 70 percent of consumers use third-party websites to compare prices.",
            "Digital-forward companies have tapped into these preferences, evidenced by the rise of used-car marketplaces with value-added services, seamless omnichannel options, and digital financing. These companies allow customers to browse a wide selection of used cars and review and compare pricing. These companies then provide nationwide delivery, relying on algorithm-based decision making for all back-end processes.",
            "Currently, many companies across the automotive value chain fail to leverage data to optimize business processes in an exhaustive way and still rely on internal experts and gut feeling for many critical decision-making processes. Adopting data-based decision making could allow dealers, OEMs, and auto finance companies to tap into customer demand, increase margins, and improve performance.",
            "Over the past 20 years, real-time automotive retail has become abundantly available, meaning that pricing should be set as dynamically as it is for airline tickets; long-term assortment decisions should be curated based on customer demand, as they are in consumer retail; and throughput management should be as dynamically managed as it is in manufacturing.",
            "To capture the value associated with analytics along the value chain, used-car companies can take four steps. First, they can combine external data with internal data to create a centralized bank of proprietary data to help stay abreast of market trends and customer needs while maintaining a strategic competitive advantage. Second, rather than deploying generic tools or solutions that are available on the market, they can develop proprietary algorithms that reflect their specific business reality. Third, they can embed analytics-based decision making across all levels of the organization, rather than isolating it to individual applications. Last, they can adjust their governance and operating models to centralize core functions, enabling frontline employees to focus on customer needs. The following section outlines how different players in the ecosystem can employ these steps and the results of doing so.",
            "Digitalization can help dealers to pivot to a more sustainable business modelâspecifically, data-driven analytics can help them determine optimal sourcing and pricing strategies, as well as vehicle allocation, to cater to customer preferences. Dealers can leverage data and analytics in three ways to increase value.",
            " Dealers can use data on current market inventory to optimize bidding prices and maximize margins. Analytically driven sourcing and bidding models that leverage real-time market data can help dealers determine the desirability of a car across price levels and help determine the optimal bidding price while reducing internal costs.",
            "Exhibit 2 shows the current state of the auction process, which has an average margin of about 6 percent. An assessment of 15,000 car transactions in 2022 and 2023 identified an incremental 2 percent margin-expansion opportunity using dynamic bidding strategies that leverage real-time used-car-market pricing data, translating into a $22 billion opportunity collectively in the United States and Europe.",
            " Large national dealers can use their economies of scale to leverage differences in regional pricing to improve margins. Dealers can use real-time market demand and pricing data to allocate individual vehicles within a dealershipâs network based on the best regional market price (net of shipping costs) and holding periods to maximize margins.",
            "Exhibit 3 shows an example of the price differential (net of shipping costs) for a specific trim line of a full-size pickup truck across states. In this example, a national dealer based in Texas can leverage this real-time market data to extract higher margins by selling the car in Arizona, New Mexico, Arkansas, Alabama, or South Carolina instead of its base state.",
            "Based on cross-border potential and margin increases per vehicle, the annual opportunity from analytically enhanced vehicle-allocation strategies is collectively $1.2 billion in the United States and Europe.",
            " Dealers can embed real-time market data to assess and improve local branch and market performances. For example, dealers could optimize their pricing and inventory based on local market trends and inventory levels in a designated market area. Distributed dealerships could then enable field sales teams to make data-backed decisions in their day-to-day roles to improve performance.",
            "Gathering real-time feedback from the market on car value performance can be challenging for OEMs, and it can be difficult to know how vehicles are performing after theyâre on the market for a few years. Understanding vehicle performance in terms of value in the used-car space can help OEMs address customer needs better while maximizing margins on future launches. They can leverage data and analytics in two main areas.",
            " Different trims and feature configurations can have vastly different rates of sale and residual-value decline. Analytics can help OEMs identify the highest-performing features within the vehicle category and incorporate them in future vehicle iterations. For instance, an analysis of recently produced midsize luxury SUVs in similar segments indicated that roughly 75 percent of them have roof rails and 60 percent have laser headlights. SUVs with these features also have better residual values in the long term. OEMs in this space could use this market data to add features that maximize long-term residual value of the trim line and improve vehicle desirability.",
            " Retail markups can differ significantly between dealers across geographies. Using data and analytics to understand retail pricing across the used-car markets can help OEMs define optimal wholesale prices for lease returns or trade-ins to maximize margins.",
            "Understanding and optimizing the residual value will be critical for the global auto-finance sector",
            "âand even more so with increasing EV adoption. However, macroeconomic changes, technology disruptions, a more competitive OEM landscape, and regulation all make forecasting residual values extremely complex. Whatâs more, rising interest rates will increase the cost of financing and push auto finance companies to choose between maximizing margins and maximizing volume. Our assessment suggests that residual-value optimization could present a $20 billion margin opportunity for auto finance companies across the United States and Europe. Auto finance companies can leverage data and analytics in two ways.",
            " Leasing companies and banks can leverage historical used-car data to understand residual values across trim lines and models. Companies could then select the optimal combination based on local demand. As such, companies can select trims that they could add to their vehicle park to maximize residual value at the end of contracts.",
            " Residual-value stability can vary greatly between different configurations of the same model of vehicle. Banks and leasing companies can determine the trims and equipment configurations of a given model with the highest residual-value stability. This data can also help them identify the optimal contract length for each vehicle, minimize the rate of value loss during the lease period, and determine the best lease rate for each vehicle. Furthermore, real-time analyses of residual-value risk can help companies minimize exposure by offering a dynamic contract renewal at the inflection point.",
            "For example, Exhibit 4 shows differences in residual-value loss between two similar variants of two vehicles. Banks and leasing companies can use this comparison to recommend trim one for vehicle one instead of trim twoâbecause trim two will lose more value at the end of the lease.",
            "Companies leveraging data and analytics in the used-car market could capture their potential value across the ecosystem. Insights gleaned from advanced data and analytics can help companies make better decisions to increase margin potential, satisfy customer expectations, and improve sales performance. Companies can also leverage recent developments, such as generative AI, to build use cases that help spread awareness, encourage adoption, and improve education, even if these technologies are not required to capture value. As external factors influence the market, staying abreast of these options will be key to remaining competitive.",

            "Programmatic M&A can be one important way to weather change and create substantial value.",
            "  Our analysis of the automotive aftermarket revealed seven investment themes (areas to pursue to create value). Using these themes as a point of departure, we then surveyed 52 leading industry executives to gauge sentiment in the industry. The respondents came from European companies, but the insights from their responses are globally applicable.",
            "Most respondents agree that the industry is likely to see even more M&A activity, mostly driven by strategic investors. They also expect the automotive aftermarket to grow. And while executivesâ opinions on the most promising areas of investment vary according to their lines of business, most identified portfolio electrification, sustainability and the circular economy, and e-commerce as the most promising areas. Finally, the majority of respondents revealed that they want to conduct more M&A but do not have a clear strategy for doing so, showing a clear need for action.",
            "We developed a set of questions to help companies in the automotive aftermarket zero in on an approach to M&A later in this article. The investigative process can be expansive, but the prize is clarity and value.",
            "We surveyed 52 European executives from the sector about the seven M&A themes we uncovered in the course of our analysis (for more, see sidebar, âAbout the analysisâ). Our five main survey findings are below.",
            "In 2022â23, we analyzed the macroeconomic trends and changes that affect the automotive aftermarket and uncovered seven potential themes of programmatic M&A for the industry:",
            "Other than our survey, we tested these seven themes by analyzing recent deals and comparing our findings to what the output of our global aftermarket forecast model might suggest.",
            "Most respondents expect the automotive aftermarket to grow (Exhibit 1).",
            "However, growth is expected to slow down from 2025 to 2030 as electrification, autonomous driving, and new mobility concepts tamp down demand for aftermarket services.",
            "âAs the traditional ICE [internal-combustion engine] business declines, players will have to seek out scale to be profitable or find new business areas to move into,â said an executive from e-commerce.",
            "âHuge investments are necessary to cope with technological changes,â said an executive at an OEM. The respondent went on to say that those investments would only be possible through targeted M&A and selective partnerships.",
            "Most interviewees seem to agree. More than 75 percent of executives we interviewed expect heightened M&A activity, and nearly 75 percent expect strategic investors to drive it (Exhibit 2).",
            "About 37 percent of respondents expect significantly more M&A activity, defined as deal volume growth of greater than 10 percent per year. Respondents predict that companies with strengths in online distribution, parts manufacturing, and data and service provision will see the most M&A activity.",
            "When asked to identify the themes most likely to motivate M&A in the future, respondents highlighted electrifying the portfolio, doubling down on sustainability and the circular economy, and entering e-commerce and building capabilities.",
            "Electrifying the portfolio came out on top as the theme most likely to drive M&A activity. This finding dovetails with one executiveâs assessment that electric-vehicle (EV) adoption and vehicles that come with software will reshape the aftermarket business. Indeed, executives across the value chain expect industry participants to increasingly rely on M&A to configure their EV-related business models, expand their EV offerings, and strengthen their EV capabilities.",
            "Market dynamics, technology advancements, and regulatory pressures are pushing the industry toward sustainability and the circular economy, which ranked second for respondents. Demand for green offerings and evolving regulatory requirements will make circularity more important. Just in time, companies in sustainability have been professionalizing, bolstering their capabilities and offerings.",
            "Entering e-commerce and building those capabilities ranked third. This theme reflects the growth of online distribution channels and winner-take-all dynamics in e-commerce that create a need for scale. The e-commerce space also offers significant opportunities for intermediary players.",
            "Respondents in the same sectors of the automotive aftermarket tend to cluster around similar opinions.",
            "When respondents ranked the seven investment themes according to their potential to drive M&A activity for the industry, electrification emerged as a top priority across sectors. However, e-commerce companies and repair shops put the most weight on the acceleration of online distribution. By comparison, parts manufacturers and data and services providers regard the scale-up of data-driven business models as critical investment themes (Exhibit 3).",
            "Respondents also pointed to different lines of business within the aftermarket as sources of attractive M&A targets. For instance, OEMs and intermediaries found remanufacturing the most attractive part of the industry, citing escalating regulatory requirements related to remanufacturing, the circular economy, the still-moderate level of competition, and other factors. Wholesale distributors, meanwhile, think their own field is the most investable part of the automotive aftermarket because of the size of the market and the growth outlook.",
            "Weâve observed that some industry participants either already have clear M&A strategies or are developing them. Most of the aftermarket executives we surveyed expect the importance and level of M&A in the sector to increase until 2030. More than 60 percent of respondents are considering investments, but only 13 percent have a clear M&A strategy or a list of targets to pursue for the next three years.",
            "Aftermarket participants would ideally have a clear point of view of their midterm strategy, in which M&A is an important route to value creation.",
            "From 2012 to 2022, more than half of the deals in the sector aligned with the theme âdo the same, but bigger and better.â And while deals to connect and activate the ecosystem, which are focused on backward and forward integration, have become more common, decision makers in the automotive aftermarket can consider the other themes we identified if they can clearly and effectively answer eight questions:",
            "For companies without specific strategic plans for M&A, the seven themes weâve identifiedâand the set of questions to guide their inquiryâcould be a place to start. Opportunity waits for automotive aftermarket companies in Europe and beyond.",

            " Intuitively, areas with high volumes of new-car sales may seem to be obvious targets for EV adoption, but the reality is more complex, hinging on considerations such as local economic and regulatory conditions, access to charging infrastructure, and consumer preferences. For example, Tulsa, Oklahoma, has one of the highest new-to-used-car sales ratios but a low EV adoption rate: about 1 percent of new-car sales in Tulsa in 2022 were EVs.",
            "Cincinnati and Pittsburgh have surface similarities. Both are midsize metropolitan areas with household incomes near the national average. Cincinnati counted 2.26 million residents in 2021,",
            " with a median household income of $68,000 per year. Pittsburgh had 2.35 million residents",
            " and a median household income of $64,000 per year. The two cities even have similar rates of electric-vehicle (EV) adoption: about 0.25 percent of vehicles in operation are EVs.",
            "But the cities diverge in significant ways. Used cars represented a greater share of car sales in Cincinnati than in Pittsburgh: three used cars are sold for every new car in Cincinnati, while two used cars are sold for every new car in Pittsburgh. Furthermore, Pittsburgh had higher online parts sales compared to Cincinnati.",
            "Micromarkets within a single city can also differ significantly. For instance, the two Cincinnati zip codes that sell the most used cars sell 8,000 to 12,000 used cars a year, while some other zip codes in the city sell fewer than 500 used cars per year (exhibit).",
            "In light of these differences, sales strategies in Cincinnatiâand in each cityâs micromarkets that are more likely to buy used carsâmight emphasize aftermarket parts, extended warranties, and prepaid maintenance plans because cars are more likely to need them. Meanwhile, the Pittsburgh metro area may be well served by a holistic offering, which spans from new-car sales to aftermarket parts and services.",
            " Markets with the highest population growth do not necessarily have the highest dealer concentration. For example, the population of the Fort MyersâNaples, Florida, metro area grew by more than 20 percent from 2010 to 2020, but the region has below-average dealer concentration (12 dealers per 10,000 cars sold). On the other hand, the population of El Paso, Texas, was fairly stable in the same period but has one of the highest dealer concentrations in the data set (22 dealers per 10,000 cars sold).

            "Done right, micromarket-level insightsâat the DMA level or at the zip code levelâcan complement and boost the impact of existing strategic moves. Decision makers can set micromarket-specific goals and integrate micromarket data into performance management. They can then set plans for each micromarket, build an execution engine to implement those plans, and continuously refresh and refine their strategies (see sidebar âMicromarket insightsâ use cases throughout the automotive ecosystemâ).",
            "Setting performance goals at the micromarket level means using the insights to determine the goals for each micromarket. Using this system, a market that has outsize growth potential would set a loftier goal than a market whose realistic growth potential may be below average. For many organizations, this approach would be a departure from setting goals based on historical performance or even competitor performance.",
            "The point of this exercise is not to get extremely precise outputs but rather to address smaller markets better. Many organizations in auto retail and aftermarket already have the capabilities to do this analysis, but it can be data-intensive. Other B2C industries that have sizable retail footprints already do similar work, breaking down markets by zip code.",
            "Similar to goal setting, micromarket data can be a tool to measure and manage performance based on market-specific potential instead of other measures, such as the performance of previous years.",
            "The key is to choose meaningful metrics at the micromarket level and relate them to incentives for the relevant teams. For instance, an auto-parts retailer that wants to cultivate customer loyalty in a micromarket might realize that only rewarding store managers based on revenue and profits at their stores may not accurately reflect their goals. Managers who are motivated to maximize store revenue and profit may prioritize customers with large purchases over those who make smaller purchases now but whose spending may grow with their loyalty to the retailer.",
            "Creating as many plans as there are micromarkets may sound daunting. The task can be simplified using technology to analyze the requisite data.",
            "The outputâhypergranular insights and diagnosis of opportunitiesâis another tool in local-market managersâ belt. Itâs not necessarily a big change for local-market managers, who are often already primed to seek the right combination of initiatives (at national, regional, and local levels) to reach their goals. Managers may decide to make changes as small as increasing online marketing or as big as building a new store.",
            "The basics of this execution engine are intuitive: KPIs and targets for each initiative, defined incentives for retail outlets, dedicated owners and sponsors for each initiative, and a central office to direct the execution.",
            "What sets it apart is the focus on micromarkets, which requires customization, including tailored marketing, offerings, pricing, and distribution. This level of customization can be time consuming and often needs to be supported by additional resources and expertise in areas such as data analysis, market research, and strategy. And because micromarkets change more quickly than larger markets, decision makers may need to adjust their strategies more often than they would otherwise.",
            "Micromarkets are more dynamic than larger ones, and decision makers could test their strategies frequently using updated data.",
            "A team may update their inputs monthly or quarterly and rerun analyses to identify any trends, changes, or unexpected outcomes that may inform their strategies. After that, they could compare their existing strategy with the updated insights to identify opportunities, strengths, and weaknesses before adjusting their market-specific strategies. Automotive OEMs may use micromarket data to, for example, merchandise EV-specific products in DMAs where EV adoption is high or growing quickly. Crucially, decision makers could consider events in the macro environment in each strategy update. Regional, national, and global events; developments in the financial system; and even natural disasters can help refine teamsâ insights and thinking.",

To test this assertion, we asked more than 4,000 customers across France, Germany, and the United Kingdom in our regular McKinsey Mobility Consumer Pulse Survey for their thoughts on the future of auto finance. We wanted to know if and why customers appreciate leasing offerings and add-on features, as well as whether they are willing to pay for such features. Further, we wanted to gather more information on the use and true cost of all-in service deals, which are now becoming a necessity.",
            "Offering additional features in auto financing is not new, especially with the move from financing to leasing. Survey respondents associate leasing primarily with the inclusion of all-in services. This is even more apparent with full-service leases, where insurance and maintenance are also included. Respondents believe that such leases eliminate many issues, such as the need to sell their vehicle. The recent proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) has increased this sentiment. Consequently, we assume the share of leasing will increase in the coming years.",
            "In addition to key services, such as insurance and maintenance, we asked customers to rate the importance of other features in leasing contracts. The number-one add-on is additional flexibility during a lease contract. This could mean the ability to switch to another leased car during a leasing period, for example. Overall, about 70 percent of consumers consider flexible-ownership models more important than the vehicle brand itself. Furthermore, automatic CO",

More than 60 percent would be willing to pay at least 10 percent more for a contract pause or for the termination of the contract.

In fact, over 45 percent of them outperform the market, while only 30 percent that donât make new businesses a top three priority do the same. McKinseyâs research suggests that if made during early periods of turbulence, these kinds of investments can have an outsize impact on a companyâs recovery later on.",
            "We believe now is the time for industry incumbents to embark on business building strategies.

By committing to building new businesses, incumbents are entering a race with the many start-ups that are attacking the mobility space. Known for fostering innovation, start-ups typically exhibit five key strengths that distinguish them from incumbents: they adopt agile ways of working, develop innovative value propositions, nurture cultures that attract talent, cultivate greenfield solutions, and provide a safe environment for rapidly trying, failing, learning, and trying again. While adopting these hallmarks poses a challenge for most incumbents, they nonetheless can accomplish it, given the right levels of commitment, ambition, incentives, and freedom to act.  ",
            "The companies that currently inhabit the automotive industry have little in common with the incumbents of yesteryear. They have weathered the combined challenges of a pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, fickle economic winds, changing technology archetypes, and much more. In addition, they have arguably navigated through the current macroeconomic environment better than many mobility disruptors who had initial public offerings within the past five years.",

            "Unlike start-ups, incumbents have many years of experience in the industry. An incumbent typically has an existing customer base, a balance sheet to fund new ventures, cash flow that provides working capital, a strong brand to reach wide audiences, and subject-matter experts with deep knowledge.\nIncumbents can also capitalize on their experience with managing physical productsâsince an estimated 70 percent of new automotive business will likely center on a physical productâsomething start-ups struggle with, and incumbents can exploit to outdistance their rivals.",
            "While the physical product is important, itâs only one part of the greater mobility ecosystem. Incumbents must build ecosystem products and employ their market presence in terms of credibility and relationships to build a differentiating ecosystem for their new ventures.

            "While long-time industry players enjoy some key advantages over start-ups in understanding the automotive âlay of the land,â our analysis shows that many will likely fail to build successful new businesses that scale for several key reasons. These include failing to exploit the incumbentâs core business strengths in the new enterprise, failing to secure the needed capital or talent, and short-circuiting longer-term success to capture near-term profitability. Other reasons involve dragging down the new business with bureaucracy and failing to instill a riskâreward culture. ",

The former struggled with identifying clear customer needs. Their smartphones focused on flashy features the company assumed would be desired by customers, though they often lacked the compatibility and simplicity of competitorsâ phones.

This move included a new governance structure that gave the businesses greater autonomy via stage-gated funding rounds.

            "When developing a business, most incumbents tend to go in reverse order, starting with a product that is already technically complete and seeing if a market is big enough or attractive enough for its introduction, then asking marketing to develop messaging that will help it resonate with target consumers.",
            "A leading OEM took the opposite approach, and in the space of five weeks was able to define two major businesses outside of its core operations that it plans to pursue further. Even though this company had a suite of designers, R&D engineers, and business development personnel, it realized how different the design thinking approach was from anything it had done in the past. The company deliberately moved away from its typical approach to new product development, which involved R&D first creating a product that could be interesting, then business groups determining what customer segments would be most appropriate, and then relying on marketing to push interest forward. Instead, it started with dozens of exploratory user interviews and synthesized the common themes that emerged from the conversations. ",
            "From those themes, initial concepts emerged through workshops comprised of cross-functional company employees. It then tested these concepts again through exploratory interviews to further refine and iterate the results. To satisfy the data-backed nature of the incumbent, the team complemented the qualitative findings of the interviews and workshops to test interest at a much larger scale, while also testing willingness to pay. Through this process, the team quickly built conviction in its business concepts, first on the desirability of the concept and second on its business viability. The conversation then shifted to, âHow can we build this?ââa question the incumbent had plenty of tools at its disposal to answer.",
            "Thereâs a saying that a great business is 10 percent idea and 90 percent execution, but even identifying, and more important, prioritizing, new business concepts can be early stumbling blocks for incumbents. Below are some suggestions for how to be successful in making this critical first step in the business building journey (for more information, see sidebar âHow itâs done: A case studyâ):",
            "Starting from an entirely blank sheet of paper for new business ideation can be a pretty daunting task that can lead to stalled momentum, or worse, an idea that is too far afield from the core that thereâs no âright to win.â Our research and experience show that the best new ventures are rarely a 90-degree turn from the core; they are most often found in adjacencies that leverage an existing strength of the business in a new way.",
            " Take a customer-centric approach from the outset to identify where there are unmet needs in identified markets and themes. This will require incumbents to learn about the audience for whom they are designing and ask what customer needs and behaviors are important through quantitative and qualitative approaches. ",
            "The most successful businesses sit at the intersection of three separate but interrelated spaces: ",
            " (does it solve a pressing need for customers), ",
            "(is the opportunity space large enough to deliver that value proposition, and can it be profitable), and ",
            "(can you be successful in building and executing, and do you fundamentally have a right to win). Evaluating business ideas against all three of these criteria will help to create clarity on which ones have the highest potential to be successful down the road.",
            "Most incumbents approach a future endeavor, be it a new product or new market, with a heavy reliance on the pastâtemplates, project plans, budget requests, and numerous other documents. These items often form the foundation of future projects and, if unchecked, can lead to a reliance on incrementalism rather than examining what the art of the possible could truly be. ",
            "A leading OEM was confronted with this same dilemma when developing the plan for the launch of a new business that was adjacent to its core, but with elements (business model, go-to-market approach, organizational structure) that were very different from any initiative this OEM had ever undertaken. The team leading this effort took two deliberate steps that underpinned its success. ",
            "Once the incumbent has prioritized a business concept, it needs to rapidly and iteratively plan how to build, measure, and learn to bring the product vision to life. Three suggestions can help. (To see these steps in action, see sidebar âBlueprinting the business before it is built: A case study.â)",
            " Establishing focus and attention for a specific segment of the customer base is critical to create capacity to go deep in really understanding the targeted value proposition, feature set, and willingness to pay for a new product. Start by developing a clear understanding of how customer segments break down and where the intersection of desirability, viability, and feasibility is strongest. Then use this specificity to inform your go-to-market strategy, including understanding purchase decision journeys, engagement points, and marketing/brand strategies.",
            " Speed to market is paramount to get products in the hands of real customers and accelerate the iteration and feedback loopâand it is the best way to determine planning and development. Typical issues include what are the quickest MVPs that can test the key assumptions of the offering, how can the incumbent rapidly prototype and test the MVPs and scale them over time, and what is the product road map (for example, user stories, feature backlog).",
            " Although speed to market is a priority, a forward-looking approach is necessary to plan for scale in the iterations ahead. The optimal solution for low-volume prototyping is different than that for manufacturing and sourcing needs at scale. Common questions to consider are: What are the technology, infrastructure, and systems integration requirements for building the product? Are there opportunities to partner, make, or buy, and can they accelerate speed to market?",
            "Once the company has defined the MVP and its rollout plan, it is time to build and launch the business, which should include the following considerations.",
            " Moving at speed will often mean creating a significantly different mindset and process for product development and business building than exists traditionally for incumbents. Creating separation from the core so that the new team can operate independently is critical, balanced by clear governance and funding mechanisms that create transparency and derisking along the way.",
            " Beyond filling identified critical capability gaps that likely exist in the core to deliver new ventures (for example, software engineers, product managers), bringing in new talent from outside the company also helps to inject new energy and establish a new identity/culture for the team. Attracting and retaining this new talent will require new ways of recruiting, a new employee value proposition, and new incentive structures that will likely vary significantly from the core.",
            "Bringing one or two lighthouse customers âinto the tentâ to codevelop the first version of your product is a great way to ensure that you are not building in a vacuum. As an added benefit, these customers can become your first evangelists who advocate for your product early and build momentum.",

The advent of digital technologies and the evolution of multiple agtechs have put the farmer right at the heart of the entire ecosystem. Solutions have begun to be more farmer-centric: each part of the value chain that is digitizing, be it finance, inputs (products needed to grow crops such as seeds, agrochemicals, and fertilizers), or advisoryâare directly targeting the farmer.",
            "Between 2013 and 2020, the agtech landscape in India grew from less than 50 start-ups to more than 1,000, fueled by increased farmer awareness, rising internet penetration in rural India, and the need for greater efficiency in the agriculture sector.",

            "Indiaâs government has also taken several policy steps and conducted pilots to foster technology and innovation in the agricultural sector:",
            "These initiatives are building an agtech ecosystem in the country, supporting farmers in areas where they need the most help.",
            "With government initiatives and the openness of farmers to tech adoption, agtechs are poised to engage with Indiaâs farmers, but to be successful, they will need stable sources of funding and a vibrant, supportive ecosystem.",
            "Agriculture technology in India has flourished with the growing attention from venture capital (VC) in recent years. Accel and Sequoia Capital invested in companies such as Samunnati, Ninjacart, DeHaat, and Bijak.",
            " During the past four years, agtechs in India have raised roughly $1.6 billion. VC firms invested more than $1.2 billion in 2022 alone through 114 deals, a 50 percent increase from 2021 and triple the investment made in 2020. The average deal size is growing, indicating that start-ups are maturing in this space despite an economic slowdown during the past two years (Exhibit 2).",
            "Of nine agtech categories, 90 percent of all VC funding was directed at five categories in 2022 (Exhibit 3):",
            "Unlike the rest of the world, where agricultural investment has centered on innovative foodsâthink Impossible Burgers or other plant-based foodsâinvestment in India has centered on the basics: financing and technology to improve agriculture and farm practices   and to avoid climate risks (such as droughts, pests, and flooding).",
            "As a result, investors approach India with a different view. Our interviews with VC firms suggest that they focus on five factors when making decisions about new technologies: the size of the market, the breadth of offerings, traction with customers, an ability to scale, and the X factor   (intangibles such as the learning curve it takes to use the new technologies efficiently).",
            "Investors in Indian agtech are, or should be, asking some basic questions, including the following.",
            " Unlike e-commerce, agtechs get low transaction volumes for farmers but pay high acquisition costs, such as to get a farmer to install an app and try a product. This is complicated by the ceaseless efforts of multiple agtechs and incumbents to enter the space, lowering costs, and the farmers themselves being willing to experiment with multiple apps in the quest for most value.",
            "To overcome this challenge, start-ups such as Gramophone, Samunnati, DeHaat, and more  are offering more touchpoints and broadening their product portfolios to provide services across the value chain, from inputs and financing to advisory. Even platforms that start out with a single use case are expanding into adjacent parts of the value chain.",
            " In rural India, both physical and digital infrastructure are important. Although 75 to 80 percent of farmer households have access to a smartphone,",
            " most still prefer to have physical touchpoints for digital support such as tutorials or help with app installation. Agtechs such as Agrostar and DeHaat have field teams to make on-ground visits and to drive campaigns for greater penetration of their apps.",
            "One way to support a customer: the ITC e-Choupal ecosystem has managed to bridge the gap in rural digital infrastructure through a network of central sanchalaks (overseers), who act as physical touchpoints for the ecosystem and on whom farmers continue to rely.",
            "In-person contact with the farmer can happen in multiple ways. Field representatives are one option. Other examples include a fertilizer supplierâs presence in Indiaâs local micromarkets or rural bank branches for agrifintechs.",
            " The right monetization model is crucial. Some firms are trying to monetize advisory services, but most farmersânot just Indian farmersâare reluctant to pay for advice. In general, advice is a gateway to business, not a business itself.",
            " Agtechs that rely less on investments in assets can scale up across geographies quickly. For example, Agribazaar had reached $2,250 million of gross merchandise value in fiscal year 2021,",
            " with a fixed-asset base of around $2.5 million.",
            " It did so by shifting the responsibility of storage, quality checks, and transport to buyers and sellers on the platform for the majority of transactions.",
            "Agtechs that require investments in physical infrastructure or assets typically try to keep their models dependent on local entrepreneurs who make the investments in equipment and facilities. For example, DeHaat and Agrostar use village entrepreneurs to provide last-mile service and deliveries within villages, enabling them to aggregate demand and deliver larger volumes.",
            "The investors and agtechs that navigate Indiaâs unique hurdles may see boundless potential. The next three to five years will be critical for incumbents and new players.",
            "It likely wonât become a winner-takes-all market. A few major players, especially those with strong supply chain linkages to the farm, could emerge as dominant players in this space. These companies could support a host of smaller, niche players that will in turn leverage the end-to-end platforms for growth.",
            "Collaboration will be crucial. While agtechs might facilitate better decision making and replace manual farming practices like spraying, reducing dependence on retailers and ",
            ", incumbents remain important in the new ecosystem for R&D and the supply of chemicals and fertilizers.",
            "There are successful platforms already emerging that offer farmers an umbrella of products and services to address multiple, critical pain points. These one-stop shop agri-ecosystems are also creating a physical backbone/supply chainâwhich makes it easier for incumbents and start-ups to access the fragmented farmer base.",
            "Agtechs have a unique opportunity to become ideal partners for companies seeking market access. In this scenario, existing agriculture companies are creating value for the farmer by having more efficient and cost-effective access to the farmer versus traditional manpower-intensive setups. Itâs a system that builds: the more agtechs know the farmer, the better products they can develop.",
            "Indiaâs farms have been putting food on the table for India and the world for decades. Digital technologies could enhance production at every step, from high-quality agriculture inputs to world-class agriculture outputs. This could help create sustainable growth for the Indian farmer, boost economic fortunes in rural areas in a flourishing ecosystem, and benefit the entire economy.",

            "Operators of industrial processing plants are particularly well positioned to capture the benefits of AI. Many already rely heavily on data-driven decision making using processing data (combined with commodity supply and demand) and pricing data. And most plants today have made significant investments in enablers of AI, such as network design, control systems, and historical data capture.",

This article explains how AI tech and agile methodology can help organizations rapidly capture value as well as how adoption of AI can revitalize people and processes.",
            "A typical process plant uses sensors to collect thousands of process measurements such as flows, temperatures, pressures, and levels, which provide the information to the control logic for the various controls.",
            "Yet most industry players do not have robust programs for managing the accuracy and reliability of critical process measurements. Maintenance requests are typically initiated when plant operators observe issues with measurements. However, many plants lack a systematic approach for maintaining the quality of critical measurements, in large part because they donât have a reliable way to track which of the thousands of measurements are most critical for effective operations. Prioritization is based on general understanding and experience, but a lack of a systematic approach leaves gaps in coverage.",
            "Feedback from plant sensors is then processed by three types of controls, each with different levels of robustness: basic single-variable control loops, advanced regulatory controls (ARCs), and advanced process controls (APCs).",
            "Single-variable control loops control a single process measurement to a given set point, such as a desired flow value, using a manipulated variable such as a control valve (Exhibit 1). A key limitation of such processes is that isolated loops donât take the real-world interaction of other process variables into consideration. Furthermore, multiple single-variable control loops within the same system do not account for one another, which can lead to single-variable controllers âfightingâ to achieve their own set points and negatively affecting other process variables being controlled by their single-variable controllers.",
            "To overcome the limitations of single-variable controls, some control schemes will integrate multiple single-variable controllers that use logic strategies such as feed-forward, ratio, cascade, and auctioneering control. Although the single loops still act on one input and one output, the overall scheme accounts for real-world interactions and attempts to mitigate the negative impact on critical process variables. The advantage of this approach is that it can be implemented directly in the control system without additional tools. The trade-off, however, is that many processes require complicated ARC control schemes, and as these schemes become larger and more complicated, they are increasingly exposed to instrument failures.",
            "APCs use different fundamental control algorithms to regulate controllers (Exhibit 2). APCs are typically implemented above regulatory process controls and work toward achieving specific objective functionsâsuch as higher efficiency, throughput, and qualityâby balancing interactions between basic process control loops within a process unit.",
            " Many APCs create process models and control multiple process variables. Other APCs use a rules-based approach such as fuzzy logic to imitate the knowledge and actions of human operators. Either way, all APCs require ongoing maintenance to account for changing process conditions. At many sites, APC usage drops significantly over time and can reduce the impact of initial capital and engineering investments. And in some cases, less than 10 percent of implemented APCs remain active and maintained.",
            "One of the main challenges in maintaining and improving existing regulatory and APC systems is their sheer size. With thousands of process measurements, control loops, and highly complex APC systems, many engineering initiatives are unable to systematically prioritize and focus on areas in which improvement would have the most impact. This is where AI can help unlock additional potential.",
            "Process plants have the following elements in place to create new opportunities using AI: ",
            " Process plants have made significant investments in capturing historical data, which makes them an ideal environment for AI. Most plants have years of detailed historical data on process conditions and performance. In addition, most industrial sites have a robust and secure network design that allows them to integrate the latest advancements in cloud technology and gather organization-wide data in a centralized data lake.",
            " In addition to infrastructure, process plants have subject matter experts (SMEs) with deep expertise in their systems. Providing AI assistance to such SMEs can help maximize the impact of AI solutions. That said, it would be unreasonable to expect subject matter experts to sift through multiyear historical data across thousands of parameters and identify all relevant insights. They can instead look into specific variables in which they already understand what theyâre looking for, which leaves significant potential for using an AI approach.",
            " Recent advancements in cloud-based storage and computing have lowered the technical threshold for deploying AI solutions.",
            " Smaller players in particular can quickly deploy and test AI solutions without major infrastructure investments. In addition to the availability of cheaper storage and computing, AI tools and deployment methodologies have gone through a renaissance. Standardized tools and ways of working have made AI deployments a matter of established playbooks rather than original research projects. Standardized tools and methodologies also enable a wider talent pool. Although most basic and advanced process controls are proprietary technologies that require specific experience, data engineering and AI expertise are significantly more transferable across systems and organizations.",
            "Some APC vendors have started integrating elements of advanced analytics (AA) and AI to improve the accuracy of their process models. However, AA and AI usage within APCs is limited to improving the APC models. Building AA and AI capabilities within the organization and applying them across a process plant at a larger scale represents a much larger opportunity (see sidebar, âWhy process plants are well positioned to benefit from AIâ).",
            "AI solutions are the best option when they can help process huge amounts of process data and identify the most powerful opportunities. Although other computing systems rely on being programmed with explicit rules, AI systems can be used to discover relevant rules through supervised and unsupervised learning from large amounts of process data. Instead of subject matter experts identifying all the rules and relationships governing a process, AI can detect patterns and insights that are not easily visible to humans. Subject matter experts can then take these insights and integrate them into their operating recipes to improve performance. In this way, AI can help owners and operators optimize traditional process control and operations (Exhibit 3).",
            "AI can serve as a decision support system to help identify opportunities that may not be visible to humans in highly complex industrial processes, such as plant performance for various ore types. It can also help improve data quality and detect sensor malfunctions. For example, AI tech has been used to identify the following issues and opportunities, which would usually require experienced subject matter experts to identify:",
            "As an example of underused controllers, a zinc smelter was not achieving the expected recovery in its fumer process. An investigation revealed a dual root cause: operators did not trust the controllers, and the hard operating limit at which the slag frozeâ1,100Â°Câled to manually operated temperature controls with a large buffer. Using AI helped to identify the root cause of past underperformance and identified process controls that needed improvement. This led to a high utilization rate of the improved process control, a reduction of 22Â°C in the average temperature, and a significant uptake in recovery.",
            "In another example, a large ethylene player struggled to consistently reach production targets while keeping a high conversion rate in the process. Only a limited amount of process variables were being used, and a larger set of process variables highlighted a new set of nontrivial interactions.",
            "Along with improving process controls, AI technology enables players to identify and optimize operating recipes under different process conditions.",
            "Operators rely on their experience and intuition to run plant processes. Many have deep expertise in operating their plants, but the element of human bias and the tendency to maintain the status quo have an impact on the potential for continuous improvement. AI technology allows the detection of additional patterns and insights that are not easily visible because of the highly complex and variable nature of chemical processes.",
            "As an example, operators at a large open-pit copper mine believed there were only three ore types to process, one of which was by far the most prominent. As a result, they rarely changed the processing set points (or the ârecipeâ). However, machine-learning tools revealed that there were in fact seven distinct ore types, and the types feeding into the mill were changing far more frequently than the operators realized. This presented an opportunity to use sensors, analytics, and process controls to identify these changes in near-real time and to update the processing recipe to suit the ore types. Overall, the new recipe led to a production increase of more than 10 percent in less than six months.",
            "Robust AI solutions can also help identify the optimal operating recipes under varying process conditions, such as across changes in the feed quality or in the desired product mix. These AI systems continue to learn and improve over time. AI can also help identify and document insights related to the intricacies of operating process plants. This helps to create consistent performance across operators and retains the expertise within the organization as older operators retire.",
            "Process plants that maximize the insights from their data by using AI solutions can improve performance and continuously adapt to changing market conditions. In industries with volatile margins and a multitude of supply chain and regulatory pressures, the organizations that make the best use of data and remain flexible will have a significant competitive advantage over their peers. For instance, the market sets prices for commodities that these plants produce, so the main levers to improve profitability are reducing costs and increasing efficiency. AI can help on both of those fronts by improving production using the same amounts of energyânot only increasing production but also reducing the cost per ton produced.",
            "As discussed in a recent McKinsey publication, a successful adoption will work only through an efficient interplay of people, processes, and technology (Exhibit 4).",
            " Moving forward, three actions can help shift traditional thinking and enable value creation using AI: adopting AI to revitalize people and processes, enabling rapid value capture with AI tech and agile methodology, and accelerating AI adoption with generative AI.",
            "Agile implementation of AI solutions can lead to a revamp of how traditional teams work in processing plants. Traditionally, upstream and downstream processes operate as islands. By making a clear connection between these processes and enabling performance discussions of how AI detected the interactions between processes, leaders can make huge improvements in the way plants operate. Additionally, planning, operations, and maintenance teams no longer need to work in silos with rigid, formal channels of communication. Instead, small multidisciplinary teams focused on specific goals can combine their insights to find quick and effective strategies for impact.",
            "The agile approach also helps establish a culture of close collaboration and continuous improvement, in which teams work to capture additional value in weeks rather than over months and years. Quick wins achieved through the efficiencies that AI tools provide build excitement in the team and establish a norm of frequent uplifts in performance. Over time, these energized cultures help organizations stay at the forefront of their industry in terms of technological advancements and profitability.",
            "Traditional waterfall project management required months or years before a solution was ready to use. Even today, a new APC implementation can take more than a year before impact can be observed and evaluated. Agile methodology focuses on rapid deployments and iterations to ensure that the team discovers the right criteria for success and meets them. This method has transformed businesses by allowing them to operate more efficiently and capture value in a matter of weeks rather than years.",
            "AI solutions can be deployed in an agile manner, in which a proof of concept is quickly deployed to establish feasibility and potential impact. For example, at the aforementioned mine, the team built and tested data models in two-week-long sprints. Improvements were added to a backlog, which was then used to determine the tasks for subsequent sprints.",
            "This and similar methods can help reduce the risks involved in undertaking huge capital-intensive projects without a clear picture of potential impact. Agile methodology is the dominant approach in the tech industry, where it has proved its impact, and it is now increasingly common in other industries.",
            "Although both traditional and generative AI have individual value, operational benefits can multiply when the two are deployed in tandem. However, the complexity of insights and nonobvious relationships discovered by AI-based simulations or optimization algorithms can create resistance among front-line operators because of a lack of understanding of what can be perceived as a âblack box.â On this point, generative AI can explain recommendations in easy-to-understand language, thus increasing confidence and boosting adoption. However, generative AI should be seen as a supplement to traditional change managementânot an outright substitute.",
            "This is an exciting time for process controls, and many new innovations are on the horizon. Intriguing work is being done in the fields of self-tuning process loops, drift and fault tolerant control, early anomaly detection, model-free reinforcement learning, AI-driven control strategy design, and learnings from broader information networks. The organizations that invest in building their AI capabilities will be best positioned to take advantage of these advancements.",

For a broad perspective on packaging sustainability and the trade-off between different substrates and solutions, we encourage our readers to review our portfolio of publications.",
            "Nevertheless, for circular plastics to meet demand, investment will be needed across the plastics value chain. On this point, our research shows that achieving 20 to 30 percent of recycled content for plastic packaging by 2030 globally could require as much as $100 billion cumulatively, spanning collection, sortation, and both mechanical and advanced recycling technologies.",
            "Partnerships and collaborations are emerging as important tools in derisking the journey and ensuring progress across the value chain. This includes buyâsell agreements for intermediates (such as pyrolysis oil), new ventures to sort feedstock (such as plastics recovery facilities), and upstream investment by waste management companies.",
            "The US petrochemicals industry in the 2010s can provide a parallel trajectory for the growth of plastics circularity today. Starting around 2009, ethane emerged as a new type of advantaged feedstock, driven by the shale gas revolution (Exhibit 1).",
            "Leading up to 2009, there was a rapid increase in shale production as a result of breakthroughs in horizontal drilling technologies, which created significant amounts of affordable and readily available feedstock. Although this feedstock was advantaged in the United States, there was still some uncertainty around three points: sustained availability at low costs, the ability to use it at scale via greenfield new builds and retrofits, and favorable long-term economics, including oil-to-gas spread and the related economics of polyolefin exports to Asia.",
            "Around 2012 and 2013, following several years of low-cost natural gas and growing confidence in the economics, industry participants announced more than $25 billion in FIDs for crackers. This fundamentally shifted the dynamics of the petrochemical industry, and from 2017 to 2019, a number of crackers came online to process newly available ethane from shale. Several existing crackers were also debottlenecked and retrofitted for ethane and other lighter feedstocks.",
            "Similarly, plastic recycling may have reached a tipping point following four to five years of sustained green premiums and attractive margins. Seven million metric tons per annum (MTPA) of advanced-recycling capacity (including memorandums of understanding and hybrid plants, although not all reached FIDs) has been announced by chemical players as a goal for 2030, with an additional ten MTPA of committed capacity linked to public circular-economy targets. This is driven by the scale-up of disruptors as well as large petrochemical companies entering plastic recycling, often via partnerships.",
            "Notably, market premiums for post-consumer bales have declined in the past few months from levels observed over the past four years. Although the drivers are not fully clear, this decline may be caused by softening demand in some durable plastic end markets and lingering post-COVID-19 supply chain recovery. These changes likely do not imply structural change in the market. In fact, premiums for waste bales and post-consumer resin are expected to return, driven by brand commitments and consumer demand for recycled plastics, supporting the need to further develop plastic recycling.",
            "When scaling ethane crackers, upstream investment in unconventional drilling (which led to the production of shale gas) as well as new ethane pipeline development (which helped transport the ethane) were needed in parallel to building new crackers. Ultimately, this helped ensure that there was sufficient feedstock that could be produced and transported to the newly announced ethane crackers on the US Gulf Coast.",
            "Similar investments are needed upstream in plastic recycling, namely in the collection, sortation, pretreatment, and aggregation of feedstock. Our research shows that global demand for recycled content may reach approximately 40 MTPA by 2030, thanks to brand commitments to use 20 to 30 percent recycled content in plastic-packaging applications. This growing demand would require approximately 67 MTPA of incremental collection and sortation capacity (Exhibit 2). Across the plastic recycling value chain, investments totaling $100 billion may be needed by 2030 globally to support the scale-up of plastic recycling, about one-third of which will be in feedstock sourcing and preparation, with the remaining two-thirds in building out mechanical- and advanced-recycling capacity.",
            "Increasing recycled waste material requires influencing consumer behavior, building out the capacity of materials recovery facilities (MRFs), and improving sortation. This will be dependent on the state of the waste management infrastructure already in place, which differs by geography.",
            " In developed economies, recyclable waste is typically collected by waste management companies and sorted and cleaned with equipment. By contrast, developing economies often rely on waste pickers for sortation and collection.",
            "Value chain partnerships between incumbents and disruptors, between recyclers and upstream feedstock suppliers, and between recyclers and downstream offtake partners have begun to emerge as ways to derisk investments.",
            "Some leading disruptors have derisked by forming partnerships, signing memorandums of understanding, or arranging offtake agreements with large chemical companies. These connections can help disruptors create end products with more security because up-front commercial arrangements can make a stronger business case. For example, disruptors producing pyrolysis oil can secure offtake of their product, while incumbents can use the pyrolysis oil to produce circular plastics associated with a sizable premium. Similarly, waste and chemical companies are entering into joint ventures (JVs) to gain access to waste supply and increase their security in offtake agreements. These JVs can enable incumbents to build new businesses, which can grow independently from core legacy businesses.",
            "Incumbent chemical companies trying to scale their recycling efforts are working together and investing in feedstock preparation assets. For example, LyondellBasell, ExxonMobil, and Cyclyx invested in a first-of-its-kind, $100 million plastic recovery facility (PRF), which has the potential to derisk feedstock access at scale.",
            " Other companies have moved to vertically integrate supply chains. In fact, some companies, such as Revolution, already control their full supply chains, from initial setup and collection to the processing and recycling of agricultural films. ",
            "Moreover, investments are being made to enable access to waste plastics feedstock that is low cost and of consistent quality. Waste management companies are investing in MRF upgrades and waste collection infrastructure to increase access to recycling. Some incumbents, including waste management companies and chemical companies, as well as disruptors, are building out platforms to have a better mechanism to match different sources of waste supply and demand. In addition, companies across the recycling value chain are forming pilots in collaboration with local governments to increase recycling collection and access to feedstock. Although these are smaller in scale than other forms of investment, they also present an option for incumbents and disruptors alike looking to explore paths to increase their recycling.",
            "Overall, these business model innovations, as well as alternative-financing agreements and collaborations, can help reduce the exposure and risk to a single party. And this reduced risk, in turn, can make customers more comfortable investing in premiums for offtake agreements. Especially with recent price volatility, these partnerships could be an increasingly important way to derisk participation models for all parties and support the business case for investment.",

        "title": "The future of chemicals in Japan: Shifting toward global specialties",
        "description": "Japanese chemical companies have historically enjoyed strong industry performance. Building on their strengths can help determine next steps in the years to come.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " the chemical industry has shown strong overall performance, with the TSR of global commodity and specialty chemical companies increasing four to seven times over. Similarly, Japanese chemical companiesâ performance has historically been strong, including leadership in various global segments.",
            "Our research shows that Japanese chemical companies can further this success by capitalizing on proven strengths and deep industry knowledge. This article reviews the current landscape of chemical companies in Japan and highlights three themes and specific actions leaders can take to regain momentum in the industry: strengthening their specialty product portfolio, upgrading their operating model, and adapting to global markets.",
            "Despite Japanese chemical companiesâ strong historical performance, their TSR grew by 7.5 percent each year from 2018 to 2021, in contrast to 25.8 percent growth in global specialties (Exhibit 1). And although resilient global chemical companies produced strong results during the COVID-19 crises (11.4 percent CAGR in revenue since 2019), Japanese chemical companies have struggled (1.8 percent), showing lower TSR performance compared with nonresilient global chemical companies (4.9 percent).",
            "The recent TSR performance of Japanese chemical companies has largely been driven by plateaued ROIC and revenue growth. In fact, the Japanese chemical industry has shown a negative revenue CAGR of 0.32 percent over the past ten years, which is 3.9 percent below the global chemical industry and 2.3 percent below the global specialty chemical industry.",
            "In the same period, Japanese chemical companies generated ROIC of 8.8 percent, falling short of the 17.7 percent generated by global specialties players.",
            " This number was driven by the following three metrics, in which Japanese chemical companies consistently lagged behind global specialties",
            ": lower EBITA margins (7.9 percent in Japan versus 11.9 percent for global specialties players on average over this period); lower capital-efficiency ratio (1.6 in Japan versus 2.0 for global specialties players); and higher percentage of cost of goods sold (69.6 percent for Japanese companies versus 65.5 percent for global specialties players).",
            "All that said, despite the relative slowness of the past few years, the Japanese chemical industry has made material improvements since 2010â13. Thus, careful analysis of what industry leaders have gotten right can help inform actions to take in the years to come.",
            "Japanese chemical companies can build on their strong historical performance and ensure long-term success by taking three actions: strengthening their specialty product portfolio, upgrading their operating model, and adapting to global markets.",
            "This entails splitting specialty chemical business units from commodities, reallocating resources to high-growth industries, and investing in customer-centric R&D.",
            " Our research shows that as of 2021, four Japanese companies are among the top 20 specialty chemical companies in market share. More Japanese companies can follow this trend by reconfiguring their portfolios to focus on specialties; global chemical companies often offer customer-tailored solutions and sophisticated, jointly created solutions specific to customer needs. Based on 2019 revenue, the top 20 chemical players focus 70 percent of their revenue in specialties, while the number for Japanese players is 47 percent.",
            "Roughly half of Japanese chemical companies have yet to configure a market-driven portfolio, and some low-margin products are affecting profits. On this point, many Japanese companies produce a large share of petrochemicals, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, both of which are sourced from relatively expensive feedstocks (considering Japan has older, more expensive assets), leaving pressure on margins.",
            "To maintain margins and effectively shift to specialties, companies can manage the specialty business separately from commodities. Typically, both are run by the same leadership teams and consequently retain the same KPIs and decision structures. However, the strategies for cost allocation should be different. In the commodity business, high turnover and optimized operations in cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, including R&D, are required to earn sufficient profit due to small margins. In the specialty segment, however, expenditures on application development, marketing, and sales are necessary to develop products tailored to customer needs. With these differences in mind, Japanese companies can redesign their organizations to prioritize and capture opportunities in each segment.",
            " Japanese chemical players have been and still are market leaders in certain segments, with more than 50 percent of global market share in areas such as polarizers. However, market share in the former has dropped by 2.4 percent CAGR in the past ten years and settled at 45.2 percent, while market share in the latter has dropped by 1.5 percent CAGR and settled at 44.1 percent (Exhibit 2). Although both values are still relatively high, demonstrating Japanâs overall competitive strength, the drop illustrates the emergence of new entrants gaining share in niche markets.",
            "Moreover, exports to destinations such as China and Korea declined in value by 2 and 21 percent, respectively, from 2018 to 2020. And the trade conflict between China and South Korea has created demand headwinds, increasing self-sufficiency and free-trade agreements between China and ASEAN as well as competition with Southeast Asian countries.",
            "To maintain a strong position in the current landscape, Japanese companies can cultivate new markets through business-model and customer-experience innovation, which has become an increasingly important shift in the industry. That said, innovative solutions require a comprehensive approach and clearly established priorities. Japanese chemical companies could therefore restructure their product portfolios to shift to areas of high growth and less cyclical end-use industries, such as automotive and electronics, which largely consume specialty chemicals, such as catalysts and specialty polymers. To better promote these products, marketing will also be key. Japanese chemical companies currently spend less on marketing expenses (3.5 percent of revenue) than global specialties (5.8 percent) or global commodities companies (3.9 percent).",
            " To optimize marketing spending, building cross-functional teams involving members of other departments, such as R&D and analytics, as well as experts with knowledge of the downstream market, can strengthen the marketing strategy. More recently, applying digital approaches has helped companies tap new opportunities and improve return on sales performance.",
            " To drive innovation, Japanese companies have continued to invest in R&D, spending 3.5 percent of revenue in 2021, a higher proportion than the 1.0 percent by companies in South Korea, 1.3 percent in Taiwan, 2.4 percent among international diversified, and 3.9 percent for international specialties players. In absolute terms, Japanese companies have increased R&D spending over the past decade; however, patent applications have decreased 1.2 percent during this time.",
            "To better capitalize on their R&D expenditure, companies can switch from a product push to a market-back approach, which emphasizes continuous adaptation. One example is a multinational chemical company that leads in patent filings (per $100 million spent). The companyâs R&D spend relative to sales is 2.8 percent, one of the lowest proportions among global peers. Despite the companyâs lower spending on R&D, its strong R&D capabilities derive from its customer focus and global innovation networks and from partnering with its 100,000 customers globally in nearly all sectors to provide innovative and tailored solutions.",
            "This entails treating international M&A as a means of upgrading the operating model, acquiring new digital capabilities, and building a resilient supply chain.",
            " Although M&A remains a critical approach for Japanese chemical companies to expand globally, many have struggled to reap the benefits. In fact, M&A in Japanese chemicals have grown by 35 percent annually within the past ten years, yet these activities generated 37 percent less excess TSR and 1 percent less revenue growth from year one to year three compared with global M&A.",
            " That said, one global specialties company expanded its high-performance materials division three years after the acquisition and ultimately achieved 9 percent revenue growth and 78 percent excess TSR.",
            "To fully leverage global M&A, Japanese companies can better optimize their operating models to adapt to customs and demand overseas. As an example, in 2021, the cash-conversion cycle for Japanese chemical companies was 22 percent longer than the cycle for global specialties players. This is largely the result of longer days of receivables outstanding, which is 38 percent longer in Japanese chemicals, a sign that companies are still applying a Japanese-centric model overseas.",
            "Moreover, Japanese companies can pursue programmatic M&A, a strategy of conducting a series of deals around a central business strategy, often a bold strategic move such as a portfolio shift or building new businesses. Programmatic M&A is more likely to lead to sustainable growth than a âbig bangâ volume play is. As an example, a Japanese chemical company that successfully leveraged M&A and effectively expanded its geographical presence to Asia, the European Union, and the United States increased its revenue TSR by more than 700 percent in just a few years.",
            " Japanese companies can accelerate the digitalization of marketing and SG&A functions, such as customer platforms, dynamic pricing, and sales-force automation. Doing so will likely boost productivity; Japanese chemical companies currently generate 21 percent less revenue per employee than global specialties players and 34 percent less than the global industry average, despite spending a similar proportion of revenue, 14 to 15 percent, on SG&A (Exhibit 3).",
            "An end-to-end digital transformation can unlock significant savings. One example is analytics-assisted formulation development in innovation, with an impact of 0.5 to 1.0 percent EBITDA improvement potential, an 8 percent return on sales (ROS) improvement at specialty chemical business units, and a 10 to 20 percent increase in service level or sales enablement. Digital transformation will radically change the way people work, especially in Japanese companies that have higher levels of administrative work with a stronger preference for paper documents and seal of approval. Optimizing processes will enable companies to allocate more resources to sales activities and other customer-facing roles.",
            "Several leading Japanese chemical companies have begun to recognize the potential of digitalization through improving plant operation systems and effectively managing R&D activities with support from newly placed digital specialists.",
            " As chemical companies face disruptions that are likely to persist, such as geopolitical and supply chain uncertainty, it can help to reassess the costs and sustainability of the supply chain.",
            "One current reason for the lower ROIC of Japanese chemical companies is their operations in high-cost locations. According to our analysis, the share of Japanese players that manufacture goods in high-cost locations is 29 percent higher than for global players in the same segments. As an example, the manufacturing sites for one of the top European auto glass producers are found in lower-cost locations, whereas Japanese players in the same segment account for more than half of the sites located in higher-cost countries.",
            "In addition to continuously optimizing locations, renegotiating contracts and reassessing pricing strategies are also examples of strategic moves to retain profitability and growth.",
            "This entails relocating business units closer to customers, adopting English as a corporate language, and improving diversity.",
            " As previously mentioned, establishing a global operating model is key to success for Japanese companies. They must change their mindset to actively engage with global markets. When building global operating models, leading companies have relocated their business hubs, such as headquarters, business units, and R&D sites, closer to their international customers. In addition, 52 percent of global specialty chemical demand is located in the Americas and Europe, with the remaining 48 percent in Asia. Within Asia, 52 percent of the demand is based in China, with an expected CAGR of 5.8 percent from 2018 to 2023.",
            "To capture opportunities abroad, companies must be willing to relocate closer to their customers and partners to capture value efficiently. This holds true for customer care and employee management as well, to avoid providing products that go beyond customer expectations or unsuitable customer service offerings, often granted free of charge.",
            " To effectively manage the global operating model, deconstructing the language barrier can be a good starting point. A common language will improve the efficiency of global operations. On this point, Japanese chemical companies can accelerate rates of English adoption, which have been stagnant over the past decade. In our discussions, industry experts noted that most Japanese chemical companies are behind the standard level in English adoption.",
            " Japanese companies have recently exhibited some improvement in gender diversity and incorporating foreign nationals, but it has not been enough to catch up with global peers. From our analysis, on average, board members at Japanâs top ten chemical companies are only 10 percent women and 1 percent foreign nationals.",
            "Japanese companies are encouraged to continue their efforts, as data show that higher return on assets (ROA) can be realized from improving diversity in leadership positions. For example, on average, 2.5 percent higher ROA can be realized if more than one woman serves in a leadership position, such as manager, director, officer, or executive officer. Further, 2 percent higher ROA on average is possible if more than one foreign national assumes one of these roles.",
            "Japanese chemical companies have the opportunity to build on their strong foundationsâand successes of the pastâby shifting their focus in the years to come. As this article illustrates, leaders can embrace a truly global operating model by pursuing growth in specialty chemical segments. Doing so could mean the difference between increasing success or falling further behind.",

            ",",
            " accounting for around 2 percent of total emissions. Meanwhile, the industry has been subject to fundamental shifts, including increased consumer demand for lower-carbon products and increased consumer awareness of recycling and the use of recycled materials; greater demand for resource-efficient production; and heightened regulatory pressure for tighter material requirements.",
            "As one of the most energy-intensive industries in Europe, chemicals can play a special role in restructuring the energy system and reducing CO",
            " emissions. With this in mind, we studied more than 20 decarbonization projects in the chemicals industry across multiple countries, including Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. Our findings show that players can reduce emissions by pursuing steam generation, utilizing residual heat, changing electricity procurement, and improving energy efficiency.",
            "We chose to focus our analysis and illustrative examples on the chemicals industry in Germany, given the magnitude and availability of data. This does not, however, negate the general applicability of the decarbonization levers for other countries.",
            "In 2021, industry in Germany accounted for 181 MT of CO",
            " out of a total 762 MT; within industry, chemicals accounted for 40 MT of CO",
            " (Exhibit 1). Current decarbonization targets aim to reduce the countryâs overall CO",
            " emissions by approximately 45 percent by 2030, with reduction targets for industry of 35 percent or 63 MT of CO",
            ".",
            "Assuming emissions continue at todayâs levels, our projections show that the chemical industry will emit the most CO",
            " in Germany by 2030. However, unlike in other emissions-intensive industries, such as energy or transport (in which almost all emissions are driven by the combustion of fossil fuels), emissions in the chemical industry are considered more challenging to abate. Fossil fuels used as feedstock and process gas for chemical processes require technological innovation, such as the use of recycled materials, captured carbon, and alternative reduction agents. The combustion of fossil fuels for steam, electricity, and heat generation can be electrified, but some reactions require temperatures that cannot yet be efficiently achieved with electric devices. Thus, decarbonization for chemicals will need to rely on solutions specific to these challenges.",
            "To better understand the decarbonization journey for chemical players, we analyzed across multiple countries the plans of industrial clusters, also known as âchemical parks,â to substantially reduce emissions. (The ranges of emissions reduction targets by lever for different chemical parks are illustrated in Exhibit 2.) A chemical park is a conglomerate of chemical production plantsâeither owned by a single company or multiple companiesâthat shares infrastructure, such as utility supply and site services.",
            "Based on this analysis, four levers of decarbonization typically have the largest effect: steam generation, heat integration, electricity procurement, and energy efficiency.",
            "Although steam generation is the biggest lever for decarbonization, it entails phasing out coal where it is still used and ramping up carbon-free steam-generation capacities. On this point, there are seven carbon-free heat-source technologiesâbiomass, solar thermal, hydrogen, biogas, thermal storage, heat pumps, and e-boilersâeach with varying levels of commercial availability (Exhibit 3).",
            "Each heat source technology can be assessed for feasibility based on feedstock availability, regulatory applicability, and load-profile applicability (renewable-energy sources are subject to load variations, and chemical production requires a consistent base load). For instance, solar thermal energy relies on climates and regions with high percentages of sunlight, while biomass relies on dedicated energy crops, such as corn. In some cases, we determined that the best solution for low-emitting, cost-effective steam generation by 2030 was to replace the conventional generation capacity with a flexible combination of hydrogen-ready gas-fired generators and electric steam generators.",
            "Employing a combination of technologiesâand thus enabling fuel-switching flexibility, depending on relative pricingâoften proves beneficial, though this in turn requires installing and maintaining additional spare capacity. In some cases, the value of switching fuel for the most economic technology outweighs the additional operational and capital expenditures for spare capacity. However, this is a determination that should be made on a case-by-case basis.",
            "Historically, the chemical industry has wasted large amounts of residual energy in the form of âoff heatââheat that is actively cooled down for disposal. This was primarily driven by the low cost of steam generation and the lack of technologies, such as heat pumps, to recycle low-energy residual heat. However, the chemical parks we studied determined that they could connect heat sinks and sources, leveraging digital twins and heat pumps to efficiently use residual heat.",
            "Amplified by the gas shortage demand, several heat integration solutions have only recently become available. Among these technological solutions are high-temperature heat pumps, steam mechanical vapor recompression, and heat separation (Exhibit 4).",
            "Connecting heat sinks and sources either directly or by using heat pumps to upcycle the residual energy to the required temperature level can dramatically increase the utilization of primarily generated heat. In turn, off heat can be upcycled and fed into steam or hot-water grids or connected directly to the appropriate offtakes. In addition, our research suggests that minimizing the energy consumed on-site by optimizing and redesigning consumers with net present valueâpositive cases can allow companies to reduce energy demand by as much as 20 to 40 percent.",
            "Finally, heat integration enabled significant cooling water savings (and thus reduced electricity for pump operations). And digital twins of heat sinks and sources allowed for dynamic optimization of heat utilization as well as the optimal positioning of heat pumps. To maximize potential, a redesign of how heat sources are connected beyond company borders and assets is required. Leveraging digital capabilities creates models to economically simulate different options and assess feasibility.",
            "Electricity procurement can be as significant as steam generation for decarbonization in chemical parks, although it requires selecting the right strategy for procuring sources of renewable energy. For instance, power purchase agreements (PPAs) with renewable-electricity producers can help virtually or physically deliver power to the site. And although replacing gray electricity (which is produced from fossil fuels) with electricity produced from renewables can be a quick win, it requires choosing the right long-term energy-procurement strategy.",
            "With this in mind, renewable energy can be procured by purchasing certificates, such as Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin in Europe",
            "; PPAs; or investments in off-site assets (Exhibit 5). In addition, electric-grid capacity can be expanded to allow for electrification and to purchase additional green electricity as needed.",
            "Chemical parks are in a special position because they have the potential to aggregate and bundle the capacities from many different plants or consumers. In this way, they can meet increasingly competitive prices because of economies of scale. Also, they can decrease the volatility in demand by counterbalancing between different peaks of consumer demand. Thus, if a combined-cycle plant is operated by the chemical park, a green baseload can be self-produced, and only demand peaks will need to be procured externally using PPAs.",
            "The goal of increasing energy efficiency is to minimize energy losses in operations. Additional savings potential can be easy to realize because of the high number of small energy-efficiency measures. In fact, the chemical parks we studied prioritized different decarbonization ideas, accounting for a considerable potential reduction in CO",
            " emissions per year. Because of their relative simplicity, the initiatives were primarily executed by the existing site team without significant capital expenditures or the need for external support.",
            "Apart from the four decarbonization levers, there are three critical success factors to ensuring a successful journey: understanding market demands, adapting the commercial model, and governing decarbonization as a transformation.",
            "Before shaping the decarbonization journey of any company, it is vital to gain an understanding of market and industry trends and shifts in demand. It is also important to get up to speed on the priorities of production, potential third parties, suppliers, regulators, and other stakeholders. Chemical players worldwide have set ambitious targets to reduce their CO",

            "In turn, gaining full transparency on market developments can require a multidimensional market model that is built to show trends and demands by product category and type of service. The overall demand for utilities such as steam generation in chemicals is decreasing because of energy-efficiency measures in chemical plants (such as oxygen depolarized cathodes [ODCs] in brine electrolysis) and the relocation of certain commodity chemicals (such as the production of toluene diisocyanate [TDI] moving to China and North America).",

Once the full potential is transparent, measures can be identified and prioritized based on the achievable impact and the ease of implementation, considering requirements for capital expenditures as well as the capabilities of available resources and time to implementation (Exhibit 6).",

        "description": "Indiaâs chemicals industry has been a global outperformer in demand growth and shareholder wealth creation for a decade.  Its strong starting point could make it the next chemicals manufacturing hub.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " the Indian chemicals sector has exceeded all shareholder expectations, outperforming not just the overall equity market but also the majority of its upstream and downstream industries (Exhibit 1). This exceptional growth has been fueled by consistent revenue expansion, increasing margins, and a rise in multiples.",
            "The sector is projected to grow by 11 to 12 percent during 2021â27 and by 7 to 10 percent during 2027â40âtripling its global market share by 2040. This growth is expected to be driven by a range of factors:",
            "Indiaâs current trade deficit, at $9 billion to $10 billion, is expected to balloon to $40 billion to $42 billion by 2040.",
            "While exports are projected to grow at a CAGR of 9.5â10Â percent to $140 billion to $145 billion by 2040, imports are likely to grow at a CAGR of 9â9.5Â percent to $180 billion to $185 billion.",
            "Out of the three main segments of the sectorâinorganic, petrochemicals (petchem), and specialtyâonly specialty is expected to be a net exporter. By 2040, its net exports are expected to rise by around ten times, from about $2 billion in 2021 to $21 billion. At $41 billion, petchemâs deficit will be almost twice as large as inorganicâs $21 billion (Exhibit 2).",
            "While it is clear that the Indian chemicals sector is geared up for robust growth, its manufacturing competitiveness is less clear. Benchmarking the sector against six global chemicals clustersâChina, Germany, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Vietnamâacross 24 variables shows that though India is more or equally competitive on most counts, other countries have a competitive edge over India in a few crucial respects (Exhibit 3).",
            "This section analyzes Indiaâs competitiveness in chemicals across four categoriesâfeedstock availability, labor and utilities, capital costs, and regulatory environment:",
            " In the petchem segment, India possesses abundant feedstock for higher carbon building blocks (C4, C6, and C8). Consequently, its combined surplus production of butadiene (C4), benzene (C6), paraxylene (C8), and orthoxylene (C8) is significantly higher than that of its peers. However, for building blocks C1, C2, C3, and C7, India does not have sufficient feedstock to meet its downstream requirements. There is limited availability of ethylene and propylene in the merchant market, and as a result, India is dependent on imports for intermediates and end products derived from ethylene and propylene. Similarly, India imports large quantities of methanol and toluene for domestic consumption.",
            " India has the worldâs highest labor availability after China, with more than 470 million. Among its six peers, its labor costs are also one of the lowest, at less than $2 per hour. Indiaâs industrial-grid electricity and water costs are also globally competitive, at $0.1 per kWh and $0.6-0.8 per m",
            ", respectively. However, Indiaâs chemical sector faces a shortage of skilled R&D talent. Only about 1,400 chemical engineers graduate from Indiaâs top 25 to 30 universities every year. Even from this limited pool, the majority either opt for higher studies or switch streams. India, therefore, is dependent on foreign talent for its chemical R&D needs.",
            " Indiaâs infrastructure costs, across construction, material, and machinery, are up to 70 percent lower than other global chemicals manufacturing hubs. Similarly, Indiaâs material costs are 4.5 times lower versus Germany and 3 times lower versus Saudi Arabia. At 25 percent, Indiaâs corporate tax rate is highly competitive, and its average real interest rate is similar to that of global peers. While it is lower than the average rate in China, Indonesia, and Vietnam, it is higher than in South Korea and Saudi Arabia.",
            "On the back of these low rates and a razor-sharp focus on profitability, Indian firms outperform their global peers on the measure of EBITDA-to-gross-PPE (personal protective equipment) ratio. The top 15 to 20 Indian companies generate an EBITDA of more than 35 percent per unit of investment in gross PPEâsignificantly higher than the 10 to 30 percent reported by their counterparts across the world.",
            " Over the past five to seven years, India has made substantial improvements in its policy and regulatory environment, making it much easier for enterprises to establish themselves and flourish. These improvements have included the introduction of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in 2016; a revamped universal tax regime in the form of the Goods and Services Tax (GST); and simplification, digitization, or discontinuation of large numbers of compliance requirements. As a result of these developments, Indiaâs Ease of Doing Business Ranking jumped from 143 in 2015 to 63 in 2020, and its manufacturing FDI during FY16â20 exceeded the figure for the preceding five-year period by three times.",
            "On some parameters, however, India lags behind its peers. These include the ease of starting a business, registering property, paying taxes, and enforcing contracts. Getting timely environmental clearances (ECs) is also a major challenge in India.",
            "With a net trade surplus, the specialty segment is the strongest pillar of Indiaâs chemicals sector. In all, 16 specialty chemicals subsegments perform well on both cost competitiveness and market attractiveness.",
            "Today, the Indian chemical industry offers several opportunities to build at-scale businesses across several specialty, inorganic and petrochemical segments. Identifying these opportunities calls for the right balance between market attractiveness and cost competitiveness. While cost competitiveness is generally a function of feedstock availability, trade balance, and scope of value addition via process or tech innovation, market attractiveness is a composite of current market size, expected CAGR, and macrotrends.",
            "With a net trade surplus, the specialty segment is the strongest pillar of Indiaâs chemicals sector. In all, 16 specialty chemicals subsegments perform well on both cost competitiveness and market attractiveness. Two of these subsegments are the following:",
            " Agrochemicals in India is currently a $5.5 billion market, growing at a CAGR of 8.3 percent. By 2040, it is expected to account for almost 40 percent of Indiaâs overall chemicals exports.",
            " Constituting flavors and fragrances, food and feed additives, and nutraceuticals, this subsegment is a $3 billion market in India, growing at a CAGR of 7 to 9 percent.",
            "As inorganic chemicals require little processing compared with other segments, the inorganic chemicals segment is predominantly dependent on feedstock availability. India, unfortunately, has a scarcity of raw materials for most chemicals in this segment. However, it has a high demand for many inorganic chemicals, making it an attractive market.",
            "Six subsegments emerge as an opportunity for building an at-scale business in the segment, backed by high growth rate of end-use industries and natural feedstock advantages. Two of these are as follows:",
            " Growing at a CAGR of more than 10 percent, fluorine is expected to become a $4.2 billion market by 2040. Its growth will be driven by rising demand from two of its main end-use industries: pharma and ag-chem.",
            " This subsegment is expected to register CAGR of nearly 10 percent. By 2040, sodium and caustic could become a $13 billion and $11.5 billion market, respectively.",
            "In petrochemicals, opportunities are highly dependent on scale and vertical integration capabilities of chemical companies. For example, backward integration at the cracker level makes bulk polymers (polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC,  etcetera) score high on market attractiveness and cost competitiveness. However, other companies are better suited to focus on products where feedstock are easily available in the merchant market (for example, C4, C6, and C8 derivatives).",
            "India has the potential to become the consumption and manufacturing engine of the global chemical industry. It is witnessing rapid economic growth, is home to a rising middle class, and requires lower capital and operating expenses. However, numerous challenges still persist including limited domestic feedstock availability, delayed regulatory approvals, and scarcity of skilled R&D talent. These enablers and obstacles have influenced the spectrum of chemical subsegments falling in the consideration pool, in terms of both market attractiveness and cost competitiveness.",
            "Global chemical companies interested in entering or scaling up their businesses in India should, however, strategically ponder upon several questions, such as: should we cater to Indiaâs demand via exports or a local manufacturing base? What should be our resource allocation strategy for Indian operations? What could be the right business model to overcome Indiaâs structural challenges?",
            "Similarly, Indian chemical companies need to reflect upon numerous questions, such as: what type of business is suitable to enter and what is the best mode of entry? Where does the business stand across the feasibility variables (technical, economic, and social) to enter a subsegment? Can we leverage the existing supply chain, if possible?",

Two key factors contributed to the discontinuity: reduced local supply and a lack of viable import options. On the first point, the February polar vortex and resulting power outages in Texas took significant PE production offline, which caused a draw on inventories and ",
            "Â As a result, less supply was available for buyers. The secondâand more complicatedâpoint refers to the ongoing logistics disruption in ocean freight, which has reduced the possibility of viable import options.",

            "Ultimately, PE prices fell from their highest levels to approximately the cost of transport plus the price in Asia (recently at $1,600 per metric ton), but the value is still elevated due to the high cost of transport. ",
            "Over the coming two to three years, several factors will likely contribute to downward pressure for PE prices in North America: the resolution of port congestion, which will improve the reliability of imports from abroad; new ships, which will reduce the cost of transport and increase availability; and new PE production capacity, which will increase available local supply. But further disruptions, such as rising costs in energy and petrochemical feedstock, could keep prices elevated despite these factors."

            "Â to the petrochemicals industry. Early in the pandemic, quarantine measures, lockdowns, and economic uncertainties led to widespread project delays, and the last few months of the year were marked by extraordinary supply and freight disruptions. ",
            "All things considered, the industry weathered the storm remarkably well, with relatively resilient volumes and profits. This article details petrochemical companiesâ revenues and profits throughout 2020âand how they were affected by fluctuating oil prices. Our analysis focuses on demand growth in consumer packaging, as driven by increased dependency on cleaning and hygiene products and personal protective equipment, and the costs and margins of key hydrocarbons, including ethylene, polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP). ",
            "Careful study of how the industry handled value creation during this timeâincluding investments, supply, demand, margins, and pricingâcan inform a series of industry implications for 2021. ",
            "Overall, demand growth in petrochemicals in 2020 was driven by increased demand for consumer staples, such as household goods and personal products, and a drop in durables, such as automotive products and appliances. After the initial shocks of COVID-19, volume bounced back in the second half of 2020. The global ethylene cost curve flattened as the price of oil decreased, reducing feedstock advantages in regions such as North America and the Middle East. Furthermore, quarantine measures and concerns over market uncertainties led to widespread project delays. ",
            "In the fourth quarter, supply and freight disruptions increased differences in regional prices. As an example, North America saw additional supply constraints, resulting from maintenance and unplanned outages, which led to price spikes for PE and PP. However, as the price of oil continues to increase and the cost curve becomes steeper, ",
            ". Similarly, volume growth rates are expected to return to levels of projected growth based on historical trends and likely be less differentiated across types of chemicals and different regions. And low to medium utilization is expected in the olefins value chain, as planned capacity comes online.",
            "Sustainability and recycling momentum has also accelerated, garnering increasing levels of company commitment and support from government initiatives. For example, as of January 2021, the European Council imposed a levy on unrecycled packaging waste, and several large chemical companies have announced the use of recycled plastic resin. ",
            "Revenues and profits in the broader chemical industry recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. For their part, petrochemical companies continued to produce amid the economic downturn. As an example, one multinational chemical company with total assets of $26 billion reported a 1 percent increase in year-over-year production volume in 2020.",
            "Industry revenue was largely tied to fluctuations in the price of oil: Brent crude prices decreased from $50 per barrel in the first quarter to $30 per barrel in the second quarter. As a result, petrochemical companies showed a broad revenue decrease in the second quarter followed by recovery in the third and fourth quarters. Along with the price of oil, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) broadly declined in the second quarter in addition to pandemic-caused margin contraction from lower demand. As an example, low oil prices resulted in the global cost curve for ethylene and PE flattening in the second quarter (Exhibit 1). Subsequently, PE prices decreased with marginal cash costs for producers, and the smaller oil-to-gas price ratio reduced cost advantages in North America and the Middle East. ",
            "All that said, most companies showed a quick recovery to pre-COVID-19 levels in the third and fourth quarters. Petrochemical companies have been striving to preserve cash to address the uncertainties of COVID-19. In the United States, several companies cut back on spending or slowed projectsâfor example, Formosa Petrochemical indefinitely delayed its Louisiana cracker. This is less pronounced in Asia, however, as only minor delays due to quarantine measures were observed and there was little to no tempering of long-term projects.",
            "Demand growth differentiated in 2020 depended on end-market shocks and regional recovery schemes. Even so, demand recovery accelerated in all regions by the end of the year.",
            "End markets in 2020 experienced varying degrees of demand shocks (Exhibit 2). As the largest demand pool for petrochemical products, consumer packaged goods remained strong with a range of increases across end-market indexes. In addition, in-home or e-commerce consumption as well as drastically increased demand for personal hygiene and cleaning products boosted overall demand in packaging. ",
            "By contrast, industries such as durables, construction, and automotive saw a demand downturn due to COVID-19-related shutdowns. Because the chemicals industry has such high exposure to consumer and packaging, it saw strong demand growth, especially with regards to PE and PP, which are widely used in food packaging and household goods. Furthermore, demand growth of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in packaging was offset by lower demand for textiles, and demand declined for polymers commonly used in construction and automotive, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane (PU), and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR).",
            "There was high regional variance in demand as well, as China and several other countries in Asia effectively controlled the outbreak of COVID-19 in the first half of 2020 and quickly resumed economic growth. Although other regions lagged behind, end-market and regional indexes were trending up in the second half of the year, leading to the overall recovery of petrochemical demand.",
            "Although the ethylene cost curve flattened as the price of oil decreased, reducing regional cost advantages, the âstickinessâ of PE pricesâor their inability to change quicklyâallowed for relatively stable integrated margins. This increased integration has primarily benefited Western Europe (compared with cracker products only), as margins have shifted toward PE (Exhibit 3).",
            "North Americaâs ethane cost advantage was reduced, likely a result of the oil-to-gas price gap closing in the second quarter, but quickly recovered as PE prices picked up in the third quarter. In the second half of the year, value captured from ethylene increased to the same ratio as in 2019. In Northeast Asia, integrated margins remained stable when the price of oil decreased, and value distribution was consistent with previous years when value was accrued in the ethylene step. In Western Europe, integrated margins remained high as more value was captured in the PE step than had been in previous years.",
            "North Americaâs ethane cost advantage was reduced, likely a result of the oil-to-gas price gap closing in the second quarter, but quickly recovered as \r\nPE prices picked up in the third quarter.",
            "PE and PP prices showed higher regional differentials at the end of year, driven by freight and regional-production constraints. However, this dynamic should resolve once operations return to normal (supply issues were due to maintenance, outages, and a freeze in United States). Furthermore, there are no structural changes in the industry and no governments are limiting trade.",
            "For much of the past five years, Western Europe and North America have maintained premium prices over Asia for both PE and PP. As an example, over the course of the year North American PP prices were higher than Chinese prices by approximately $300 per metric ton (Exhibit 4). ",
            "This trend continued through the majority of 2020. Beginning in the fourth quarter, scheduled maintenance and operational issues limited PE and PP production on the US Gulf Coast. At the same time, there were constraints in vessel availability for international trade. For example, physical distancing requirements limited international shipping, with many vessels docked in the United States as a result of Christmastime imports. This means that vessels were limited in Asia and Europe. As a result, prices have âregionalized,â where PP prices in North America are significantly above prices in Asia. In February of this year the situation became even more strained with the Texas freeze forcing more plant shutdowns. While those constraints are not fundamental in nature, they have contributed to continued volatility and scarcity that has benefited producers that are able to operate.",
            "As the price of oil increases to more than $60 per barrel (Brent) and GDP continues to recover after the initial shocks of COVID-19, petrochemical revenues will become less volatile, making incredible drops, such as ",
            ", increasingly unlikely. On this point, regional cost advantages will resume as cost curves become steeper, and the steady recovery of indexes are expected across regions and end markets, supporting a more even recovery of volume across all types of chemicals.",
            "While some bans on single-use plastic packaging were lifted during the pandemic for hygiene concerns, the acceleration of sustainability and recycling is expected to continue, as we see more commitment from consumer-packaged-goods and chemical companies as well as government pushes, such as the EU levy on unrecycled plastic packaging. However, a new wave of capacity is expected to come online in 2021 and beyond. ",
            "Integrated margins for PE or PP may compress for marginal producers, primarily in Asia. More than nine million tonnes per annum additional ethylene capacity is coming online in 2021, outpacing the expected demand growth. Regarding PE and PP, regional price differences may once again become consistent with the past as the disruptions in production and freight are resolved.",
            "The world has changed dramatically in the past 12 months, and many industries were forced to adapt. The petrochemicals industry was no exception. Petrochemical producers have played a major role in helping society with the challenges of the pandemic. As an industry, it has transitioned into 2021 strongly, and we are seeing strong profitability. Petrochemical players should use the current good times to get ready for a new and exciting future, one that combines the power of petrochemical products and solutions within a business context.

            " margins by two to five percentage pointsâa significant competitive advantage in an industry in which historical EBIT margins are a healthy 20 to 25 percent for major players. For companies that may already be piloting advanced analytics, a small collection of similar Industry 4.0 tools (including machine learning), scaled throughout an enterprise, can create value at low risk for industrial gas companies.",
            "Such measures could grow the profit margins of an industry that already creates significant shareholder value. Industrial gas companies can apply Industry 4.0 tools throughout the value chain, such as advanced analytics to enhance plant efficiency or optimize bulk or packaged gas deliveries. Digital and analytical tools could also help strengthen supply chains that are especially crucial during the COVID-19 crisisâparticularly ones that involve delivering liquid oxygen to hospitals and enhancing capacity at dry-ice facilities that support vaccine transportation. Gas players could start by leveraging existing technologies and approaches to quickly capture value, creating a self-funding mechanism for further digital transformation. ",
            "Industry 4.0 tools could help grow the profit margins of an industry that already creates significant shareholder value. ",
            "While stand-alone facilities such as single air-separation units are fairly optimized thanks to advanced process controls, there is an opportunity to optimize more complex pipeline networks with multiple plants and gas consumers. For instance, years of historical data could be used to create a model that forecasts customer-demand volumes across the network. The model could monitor actual production and consumption across the pipeline, making optimized recommendations to meet all customer needs at a minimized cost. The models could calculate the probability of sudden changes in customer demandâsuch as a steel mill suddenly pulling a significantly higher volume amount of oxygenâand calculate an optimized output. In such a scenario, the model would simultaneously account for remaining uncertainty in the demand model and important operational-cost trade-offs, particularly between increasing pipeline pressure and vaporizing supplemental liquid. Operators can reference a display of real-time set-point recommendations for the relevant equipment as operating and ambient conditions evolve.",
            "Bulk distribution (particularly trucking) can also benefit from Industry 4.0 tools. For example, an advanced-analytics model with the proper inputs and constraintsâsuch as fleet size, fleet availability, and local transportation regulationsâcould optimize delivery of bulk gases to customers. A relevant model could forecast consumption and use inputs such as traffic patterns to create optimized delivery routes for drivers. Optimized routes would reduce the total cost for customers by reducing trucking miles and fuel costs.",
            "Furthermore, advanced models could also update trucking routes using real-time data. For example, if a highway is shut down because of an accident, the model could rerun its inputs, identify a faster route, and provide the updated route to drivers. An optimized distribution system would cut short-term costs and help industrial gas companies optimize their trucking fleets based on insights from models.",
            "In the longer term, drones and autonomous vehicles could contribute to the optimal functioning of plants and pipelines. Drones could automatically complete operator routes, collecting video data of the plant and leveraging unstructured data analysis to identify any concerns, such as ice accumulation on the top of cold boxes or unexpected leaks, and catch both safety and efficiency issues earlier.

            "Consumer confidence held fairly steady through the summer months. One-third of US consumers (compared with only 26 percent in June 2022) say they feel optimistic about their financial situation; they expect the US economy to improve in the near term. This modest rise in optimism comes in part from their perception of prices: consumers are no longer seeing the massive price hikes that caused them anxiety in 2022 and early 2023. Eighty percent of US consumers (versus only 10 percent in 2022) report seeing stability in the prices of household supplies over the past three months. ",

Also near the top of the list of concerns is their ability to make ends meet, which 27 percent of consumers cite as their number-one worry.",

On the one hand, 40 percent of consumers say they plan to splurge in the coming months. On the other hand, 79 percent of consumers are trading down to save money when they shop.",

And 28 percent of US consumers say theyâve reduced their spending on food in efforts to save money.

Customers increasingly expect experiences powered by software and on par with those offered or enabled by the most successful software and tech players. Building a shopping app, for instance, no longer suffices; the experience needs to be as engaging and seamless as it would be if app delivery were the organizationâs core competency.",
            "Investing wisely in software across the entire value chain, from initial customer interactions to internal corporate functions, can help consumer packaged goods (CPG) and retail companies meet these rising expectations. And that investment can pay off in the long run. With technology increasingly a competitive differentiator, companies that make software a core part of their organization and harness emerging technologiesâsuch as AI (including generative AI), mixed reality, and roboticsâcan lay a strong foundation for sustainable growth.",

Lego partnered with Epic Games to create a metaverse for kids to connect, playing between digital and physical worlds seamlessly. And LâOrÃ©al invested in Digital Villageâa virtual world-building platform and nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaceâto bet on opportunities within the metaverse and Web3 for virtual store creation.",

            " Our analysis of more than 120 public consumer and retail companies also reveals that those with a mature technology operating model outperform those that operate more traditionally. Markers of strong DevOps and developer tooling, modern engineering practices, best-in-class product development life cycles, and structural and strategic alignment toward products are directly tied to strong business results: organizations with high maturity across these dimensions boast, on average, 2.2 times greater return to shareholders, as well as 40 to 45 percent higher customer engagement and brand awareness, compared with those that have little or no technology operating culture.",

According to ",
            ", managers at high-performing consumer companies are 1.6 times more likely to say their digital agenda is integrated into business units rather than siloed in an IT organization.",
            "The right culture is also essential for driving customer-centric innovation. To build such a culture, companies can work to emulate the operating model of leading technology players that use small, cross-functional teams, or pods, to address specific customer needs or journeys. In this model, pods can include employees from software development, agile coaching, data science, product management, technical program management, and user design/research. The teams are typically empowered to own a customer problem space end to end, set their own objectives and key results, and determine their own product road maps and backlogs. They are actively encouraged to base their decisions on customer data, leveraging technologies such as AI and machine learning to predict customersâ needs and deliver value.",

The user design/research and product management functions are so deeply embedded in the pods that they help shape the mission statement and the problemâs definition from the get-go, rather than being used only for fine-tuning after overarching development decisions have been made. From our work with retail and CPG companies, we have seen this type of software-centric culture boost customer satisfaction rates by as much as 40 percentage points. Technology-inspired operating models also help push organizationsâ performance closer to that of software players on other metrics. For instance, in one major North American retail brand, we saw this shift lead to a 60 percent improvement in time to market, from idea inception to software delivery, for such offerings as new app features.",

CPG and retail industry product managers need to deeply understand ever-changing consumer habits and preferences, as much of their job is to optimize the digital touchpoint and make the transitions among multiple channels seamless for customers.",
            "Such consumer insight is just part of the overarching talent that sets successful product leaders apartâthe ability to deliver enhanced customer experiences creatively. Product managers have a vast canvas of modern tools and platforms to help serve customers and consumers in new, innovative ways. This capability is particularly important in the consumer retail environment, where offering product experiences that deliver value as well as establish and exceed high user expectations is a true differentiator.",

Moreover, around 60 percent of CIOs have seen tech debt rise in recent years.",
            " At the same time, not all tech debt is bad: modernizing applications adds value, but only up to a point. Consumer companies should prioritize what, how, and when to migrate to a new solution.",
            " ",
            ". A tech stack where all platforms talk to one another is critical. For example, platforms to automate marketing efforts should be able to pull from customer and product databases to personalize messaging and showcase the most attractive items. Failing to integrate these components into a unified tech stack will hinder the potential for technology-driven business improvement.",
            "While certain companies take the more challenging route of leapfrogging to an entirely new tech stack that merges all existing customer and product data, more consumer-facing organizations are likely to take incremental steps. For instance, new business logic can be built out iteratively as modular microservicesâself-contained units of code that execute specific functions with limited dependenciesâeffectively replace the legacy stack. Prioritizing platform upgrades according to the value at stake is important: drawing on our experience in the consumer space, we estimate that 20 to 50 percent of platforms may drive up to 80 percent of the value.",
            "Companies eager to upgrade their platform architecture can gradually switch to a cloud-based approach.

This approach helps to deliver high-quality, ready-to-use data sets that people across an organization can easily access and apply to various tasks, such as keeping up with changing customer buying patterns and trends. Traditional approaches, such as grassroots (managing data across the organization on a team-by-team basis) and big bang (managing data en masse in a centralized team), are highly complex and inefficient. In contrast, managing data as a product creates sustainable value by increasing reusability, interoperability, and speed of new application implementation. For example, customer and product data managed as two data products can be connected to drive hyperpersonalization; product and store data can be linked for assortment optimization.",
            "Once an organization manages its data this way, it can more effectively unlock value from it. For instance, building innovative, data-centric applications is one promising vehicle for leveraging existing data in more meaningful ways than simply modernizing existing application features. Generative AI and foundation models now open many new opportunities for data-centric applications by automating content generation based on data. These models essentially supersede much more of the value chain than traditional, discriminative AI models that are used to predict labels or classifications. For example, companies can leverage marketing data and generative AI to automatically create and deliver hyperpersonalized messages with virtually no incremental costs.",
            "Given the rapid pace of tech innovation, consumer and retail companies often find it beneficial to tap into the ecosystem of tech-forward start-ups and supplier partnerships. The attraction is mutual because the retail ecosystem, unlike software, offers tangible products and various services along the value chain.

            "For retailers, broader software integration with their supply chain also drives innovative customer experiences. One example is digital additive manufacturingâthat is, 3-D printing. It requires deep software integration between brands and manufacturers across multiple points of the product development and manufacturing life cycle. Investing in such integration can unlock faster time to market and product customization at scale.

Take the retail apparel industry, where fashion houses and mass retailers alike are expanding physical runway shows and stores into the virtual world with interactive experiences, gamified content, and new ways to generate awareness and monetize merchandise. For example, Gucci launched metaverse fashion exhibits that mirror physical ones,",

            "Some organizations are using tech to add entirely new revenue streamsâfor instance, by diversifying from B2C to B2B using analytics offerings. Walmartâs Luminate analyzes consumer data to offer suppliers greater insight into competitive positioning. PepsiCoâs Digital Lab platform provides food service businesses with various digital tools and resources to help the companies improve their operations and customer experiences.",
            "Traditional CPG companies have also been able to enter the direct-to-consumer space by leveraging technology to build a closer connection with their consumers.

In addition, it created âOreoverse,â a virtual reality (VR) world where fans can interact with the Oreo brand, connect with other consumers, and create shared experiences.",
            "To help drive innovation, consumer and retail companies should consider pivoting toward a tech-focused talent pool. High-performing businesses have already taken a more active role toward insourcing employees with digital expertise: according to ",
            ", managers at high-performing consumer companies are 1.4 times more likely to report having tech talent largely in-house for critical areas. Still, insourcing levels are relatively low; our research indicates the share of outsourced IT talent is 40 to 50 percent in retail and 50 to 60 percent in CPG. Insourcing tends to be more prevalent for critical skills, such as product management and app architecture, and less for commoditized roles, such as product support.",
            "For near-term access to bleeding-edge capabilities outside the organization, companies can employ âacquihiring,â or strategically acquiring digital-native companies to access their technology offerings and talent pools. For instance, when LâOrÃ©al acquired ModiFace, a VR company that builds technologies for the beauty industry, it successfully integrated the team into its core organization, resulting in a threefold increase in conversion rate and a twofold increase in engagement.",

            "Another approach is for businesses to establish their own talent ecosystems (for example, launching open-source projects, hosting hackathons, fostering a developer community) or to become part of existing ones created by tech-savvy organizations, thereby harnessing collective knowledge and resources. For example, DÃ¶hler, the natural-ingredient company, joined the SAP Business Network for Logistics to access services and talent from more than 22,000 partners.",
            "In the longer term, companies can attract new talent and differentiate themselves from tech-native companies by focusing on purpose-driven hiring. Consumer companies can distinguish themselves from tech-native enterprises by focusing on the relatability of their brands and the ability for talent to see the tangible impact of their innovations in the marketplace. For example, Nike promotes itself as a company looking to hire âthe most creative people in the worldâ who want to ârevolutionize the future at the confluence of tech and sport.â",

For example, one North American retail organization chose to reorient its project-based operating model as a product- and platform-based structure, which involved establishing clear roles and responsibilities across pod members, empowering teams to operate autonomously, and speeding up processes by reducing the previously required stakeholder alignment. With team members feeling newly empowered and excited to work together across functions, the company saw a 30-percentage-point increase in its talent satisfaction rate.",

A March 2023 McKinsey experiment with GitHub Copilot showed that, in teams working on e-commerce platforms, AI tools resulted in overall performance gains of 25 to 50 percent for lower- to medium-complexity tasks. Developing new features was around 50 percent faster, while refactoring authentication was roughly 25 percent faster.",
            "Consumer and retail companies that embark on this software-driven path will likely have to embrace technology as a strategic capability across many dimensions: culture, product management, ecosystems/partnerships, engineering, GTM, and talent.",
            "Most organizations that pull off the transformation begin gradually. For example, one food retailer decided on a âfrontrunnerâ approach, identifying three high-impact areas of one select business unit where it wanted to pioneer changes before rolling them out more broadly in the organization. As a result, the company gained valuable insights to refine its blueprint for operating in the new model. In addition, team members could double as champions for the new model once the changes started to scale across the rest of the business unit and, ultimately, other business units. The approach was so successful that employees from other parts of the organization actively sought to adopt some of the software-centric best practices that the frontrunners had established.",
            "Ultimately, the commitment to overall change will be more profound and even tougher to get right than introducing new tools or platforms.

An edited version of their conversation follows.",
            " Youâve had consistent growth over the years in your core business and core markets. For most companies, however, it eventually ",
            ". Product and category adjacencies are the most common avenues for finding growth. But the trajectory of growth at Westfalia has in large part come from geographic adjacencies, as youâve taken it from a single-market player to now the largest avocado company in the world. How did you bring that expansion to life?",
            " Every company wants to grow. But you cannot do it if you donât have a sound core. You might think you should start looking at new opportunities in adjacent markets, or even adjacent categories, but if you donât have a very strong and stable core, built over generations of expertise, then youâre going to struggle.",
            "Our focus has always been to be either the number-one or number-two player in a core market before we move into a market adjacent to it. And then when we move into adjacent markets, we do so with clear information and knowledge about what the adjacent market will do for our business. On the supply side, we are the worldâs largest investor in avocado research, which enables quantification of some of our risk.",
            " Many players fail when theyâre trying to grow through geographic adjacencies, often delivering below-average portfolio growth. Youâre not only managing the general volatility of entering into a new market but also the specific challenges of conducting business in that particular market. How do you create a repeatable, reliable growth formula thatâs centered on geographic adjacencies?",
            " There are different types of risk whenever we contemplate entering a new market. But there are two things we will never allow to happenâeven if the investment opportunity is wonderful. One is that we will never compromise the safety of our staff. And the other is that we will never compromise the reputation of our business, which we have built over a long, long time. So we do thorough diligence on everything before we make a decision.",
            "We believe that our mission when we enter new markets is not only to make money, which is table stakes, but also to create something meaningful in communities. Iâll use the example of Mozambique. We were the first company of size to farm at large scale there. We created employment for a lot of people. But we also gave small growers the opportunity to farm and become businesspeople in their own right.",
            "A prime reason why we invested in Mozambique was to make sure that our objective of supplying our markets 52 weeks a year would be properly met. In our research, we discovered that Mozambique has a very favorable delivery window into other markets known as seasonal pinch points, where avocados can sometimes be in short supply. In our agronomical studies, we examined where the best place in Mozambique would be to farm. We researched infrastructure, available skills, and trainable skills. Pilot studies were conducted. When we were happy with the result of those studies, we made serious capital available for the investment.",
            " You have had a long history with ",
            "Â [consumer-packaged-goods] companies. In that world, when it comes to delivering products to consumers, a lot of the variables are relatively controlled. But now that youâre also in the agriculture industry, you need to deal with the harsh realities of commodity cycles. How have you brought CPG principles into the agriculture industry while dealing with the different challenges it entails?",
            " One of the common things you will see in the ",
            "Â is that itâs very production focused. You need to be the leader in your agricultural specialtyâin our case, avocados and a few other fruitsâso you can be a supplier of quality products.",
            "But at the end of the process, the product needs to get to a consumer. Very analogous to CPG, you need to ensure that shelves arenât empty and that your retail partners are happy because your consumers are happy. I hope one of the things Iâve done successfully is to link that supply and demand side properly. Our business has radically changed over time and is now absolutely a consumer-focused business.",
            "There are three separate elements we deal with. First, we need to have a product. In the world of fast-moving consumer goods, you can generally produce that product with a machine. But we have to plant a tree and then wait patiently for three to five years for that tree to produce enough quality fruit to send somewhere. Second, on the opposite side of this process, we have consumers. We supply them mainly through a platform of retailers and food service outlets. And third, in the middle, we have a logistical platform.",
            "We really need to be masters of all three. Being consumer centric, and understanding consumer needs, makes it easier to take a company through a transition period in which itâs moved from being focused on the farming sideâwhich is still very, very importantâto connecting that with the consumer on the other side. Because, in the end, itâs all about what consumers need. If you canât meet that need, youâre not going to be successful.",
            " Over time, competitive intensity in any industry grows. Competitors move fast, and elements that used to be differentiated can become transactional. How do you maintain your competitive differentiation?",
            " Last year we experienced floods, drought, hail, and tropical storms all over the world. Before that, we had to deal with supply chain dilemmas arising from the RussiaâUkraine situation. And before that, we had to handle COVID-19. During all these challenges, all of our customers were supplied on time, in full, 52 weeks a year. Itâs what we promise to them. A consumer makes the effort to go to a store because theyâve got a product in mindâideally, avocadosâand if they canât find that product itâs a big disappointment for them.",
            "The ability to connect hundreds of global supply touchpoints and deliver product to our consumers 52 weeks a year is, I think, still something that differentiates us. So we focus intently on that. To keep our customers supplied, we diversify our footprint all over the world, in terms of farming. Our research program identifies new varieties of avocados that are more resilient, and more resistant against plant disease. And we of course pay fanatical attention to detail in terms of our supply chain.",
            "Another advantage we have is that we work closely with our retail customers, in partnership with themâespecially with our top 20 or 30 customers globally. We work with them in terms of research, category management, and making sure that we understand what the consumer wants. We try to make sure that our retailers are a destination for consumers because consumers have a level of trust with them. We want to collaborate with retail customers in ways that let them meet the evolving needs of consumers in terms of convenience, promotions, ESG [environmental, social, and governance]-related concerns, and omnichannel retailing.",
            "Performance is, in the end, the decision maker between a retailer staying with us or moving to a competitor. We have to make sure that we perform better than anybody else. We are fanatical about our service levels, our quality, and our attention to KPIs. If there are customer complaints, we work hard to understand why they are happening and what we can do about it.",
            " In terms of diffusing risk, one of the components that youâve talked about is ",
            "Â and how itâs affecting different geographies. How have you built climate research into your decision making and ultimately managed that risk?",
            " The effects of climate change are undeniable. Weâre already seeing them in our business. We work with institutions all over the world to see if we can use artificial intelligence to make better predictions about climate events.",
            "Because we have to assume that climate change will continue, we need to be geographically diversified to make sure that our customers can be served from many territories at the same time. We also have to assume that certain resources, such as water, will become less and less available. Through our research program, we are creating varieties of avocados that need less water. Also, weâre looking for the most effective ways to conserve water in irrigation. We might eventually need to decide that itâs not wise to farm avocados in certain areas, but I hope that that never happens.",
            "Meanwhile, we do everything we can to make sure that we are a responsible global citizen. For instance, we ensure that our packaging is as sustainable as possible. And we have developed partnerships to use ground avocado seeds in beauty products, replacing plastic microbeads that were previously used as exfoliator agents.",
            " Whatâs next on the horizon for you? Where is the company headed?",
            " Thereâs a lot of good work still to be done in the United States. We feel that there are great opportunities, especially in the Midwest and on the East Coast, so weâre going to work hard to bring extra consumers from those regions to the category. In Europe, there are several countries, including Italy, Spain, and all the Eastern European countries, that still havenât seen avocados in the way we present them. We feel we can offer better quality, value, consistency, availability, and ethical and environmental assurances.",
            "We penetrated India a few years ago, after proper research. Weâve got a solid business there, with our own farms, nursery, and commercial team. Our focus at the moment in India is on the big cities.",
            "Weâre also looking for new worlds to enter. And the new worlds for us are in AsiaâChina, Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia. We have already done our homework. And at the right time we will trigger a movement into those markets. Our vision is to make avocados available to every consumer in the world, and we are able to fast-track development in target countries using the experience weâve garnered from our fully integrated global operations.",

            " McKinsey surveyed 487 US Kâ12 public and charter school district administrators who either provide input into a districtâs school year budget or are decision makers who set the budget. The survey asked questions about existing Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund spending, expectations for future spending, and challenges encountered. Respondents to the survey represented a cross-section of districts by size (30 percent small, 30 percent medium, and 40 percent large); geography (60 percent urban, 30 percent suburban or town, and 10 percent rural); and income level (30 percent higher-income districts, with less than 40 percent of students eligible for free and reduced lunch; and 70 percent lower-income districts, with more than 40 percent of students eligible for free and reduced lunch).",
            "We surveyed 487 US Kâ12 public and charter school district administrators to explore these issues (see sidebar, âAbout the surveyâ). The results, as discussed in this article, reveal that schools may fall short of addressing their most critical priorities before the relief funds expire. Most districts are beset by challenges that ESSER funding alone cannot address, such as student learning delays and absenteeism, staffing shortages, deteriorating school infrastructure, and declining student mental and physical health.",
            "In the face of these pressures, leaders are making difficult choices. While they report an increasing and sustained focus on teachers, teaching, and student well-being and support, many expect to deprioritize spending on solutions targeted to learning-delay recovery. Some districts are investing in one-time infrastructure projects to spend down stimulus funds without incurring long-term commitments. Post-stimulus, districts expect to focus on basic operations, moving away from new digital tools and supplements and other purchasing patterns that emerged during the pandemic.",
            "School administrators will need to move quickly. An estimated $90 billion in funds remains unspent, and districts have yet to budget about a third of those funds. In the first years of ESSER funding, schools spent about $2.7 billion a month on average.",
            " To use up the remaining dollars, they will need to spend or obligate roughly $5 billion a month between July 2023 and September 2024. The share of relief funding spent to date varies widely by stateâin 10 percent of states, schools have spent over 60 percent of allocated ESSER funds,",

Still, the process has gotten easier over time: one-fifth of district leaders report no challenges in spending ESSER funds, double the number that responded similarly in 2022.",
            "In the remaining years of ESSER funding, more than half of districts plan to continue prioritizing both student learning delays and student mental health and well-being. The extent of this prioritization varies somewhat by district poverty levels. A larger percentage of higher-poverty districts plan to focus on addressing learning delays, whereas a larger percentage of lower-poverty districts expect to focus on student mental health and well-being challenges (Exhibit 2).",
            "For many districts, day-to-day operational challenges will take priority. Districts plan to spend most on essentials needed for schools to operate (for example, maintaining facilities, compensating teachers and staff, and addressing student behavior challenges)âa shift from the pandemic-related expenditures (such as pandemic-focused student safety and HVAC upgrades) that characterized ESSER spending from 2020 through the end of the 2021â22 school year (Exhibit 3).",
            "Four key themes emerged when we surveyed district leaders about how they plan to spend their remaining ESSER funds:",
            " More districts plan to spend remaining stimulus dollars on teacher retention, including one-time spending on professional development and bonuses. Teacher turnover has continued to rise as teachers face greater workloads and student behavior challenges, with districts leaning on one-time payments to keep staff on board. For example, Oakland Unified is spending $16 million of ESSER II and III funding",
            " on one-time teacher payments while the state of Missouri has allocated $50 million of ESSER funding",
            " toward programs to encourage teacher retention. And to help build the capacity of teaching staff, the state of Connecticut has allocated $5.9 million in ESSER funding",
            " toward a Science of Reading Masterclass for 11 districts.",
            " Addressing studentsâ physical health, mental health, and overall well-being are high priorities for most districts. Over the next three years, the district leaders we surveyed expect to increase their spending on combating student absenteeism and behavioral challenges and on broader support for student mental and physical health.",
            "Student absenteeism is a nationwide issue, with 72 percent of public schools reporting an increase in chronic absenteeism",
            " in 2022. At least six states",
            "âCalifornia, Idaho, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texasâdetermine Kâ12 funding through student attendance",

            " expressed feeling sad or hopeless for two or more weeks in the past year, and 87 percent of schools",
            " reported that the pandemic has had a negative impact on their studentsâ socialâemotional development. States and districts alike are using ESSER funding to help address these student concerns. At the state level, Illinois is using $121 million",
            " to create seven regional socialâemotional learning (SEL) hubs that will help schools implement SEL interventions and supports, and some districts, such as Washingtonâs Bethel School District, are using ESSER funding",

Yet spending on maintenance of existing facilities is expected to be the third fastest-growing district budget expenditure. This may be due to ESSERâs use-it-or-lose-it funding structure, which provides incentives for districts to make one-time investments (including for infrastructure improvements), as opposed to investing in categories that require ongoing sources of funding. New building construction, which typically requires multiple years of planning and budget allocation, was the third fastest-growing spend category in 2020â23, when more years of ESSER funding remained, but has dropped to 30th place for the next three years.",

            "Over 50 percent of district leaders hope to prioritize addressing learning delays with remaining ESSER funds, yet only about 30 percent plan to spend significantly on supports like high-dosage tutoring and intervention curricula. This may be because of concern over the high cost",

            " through 2040, with large urban districts facing the steepest projected enrollment decreases and enrollment in smaller districts expected to remain flat or slightly increase in line with recent enrollment changes.",
            "Unfavorable population dynamics are a large driver for enrollment attrition. US birth and immigration rates have been falling",
            " since before the COVID-19 outbreak, decreasing the number of school-aged children. The pandemic accelerated these trends and sparked a shift in enrollment",
            " from traditional public schools to charter schools, homeschools, and private schools.",
            "Even as financial uncertainty looms, post-ESSER inflationary pressures may continue to make addressing spending priorities challenging. Districts are planning for increases in spending across their largest budgetary line items. This may create tension between district leadersâ priorities and their concerns, expressed by more than 70 percent of district leaders, regarding their ability to continue to fund key programs post-ESSER.",
            "As district leaders plan for the drop-off in available funds after ESSERâs expiration, certain categories of spending are expected to be more resilient to budgetary declines than others. Some budgetary priorities that saw significant increases in district spending during COVID-19 are expected to sustain this spending growth even after the relief fundâs expiration. Many of these priorities address ongoing challenges that worsened during the pandemic, which the influx of ESSER dollars alone could not remedy, while others cover baseline essentials for district functions. These sustained priority-spending categories include student mental health and socialâemotional curriculum. Other categoriesâsuch as analytics and reporting toolsâare resurging in importance, and some areas, such as new facilities and teacher training, are undergoing temporary funding spikes during the relief funding period. Areas of low spending growth include general core and supplemental curricula and AI-based learning platforms and virtual reality/alternative reality software and hardware (Exhibit 4).",
            "Many school district leadersâ priorities address ongoing challenges that worsened during the pandemic and were not easily solved with the influx of ESSER dollars alone, while others are baseline essentials for district functions. Sustained priority-spend categories include student mental health (which shifted from a rank of 7 to 1 in rate of growth between the historic stimulus and post-stimulus periods) and the social-emotional curriculum.",
            "Other categories of spending such as analytics and reporting tools are resurging in importance post-stimulus.",
            "Spending on curricular materials continues to see relatively low growth post-stimulus.",
            "While many districts hope to prioritize funds for learning-loss mitigants such as high-dosage tutoring, concern over the high cost of large-scale tutoring and digital-learning programs, along with supply constraints (including tutor and teacher shortages), limit the application of these interventions at scale.",
            "Spending on new facilities saw a spike in growth during the stimulus period, but growth is expected to drop off significantly post-stimulus.",
            "Pandemic-related learning delays",
            " continue to concern districts. If student performance improvement follows historical prepandemic trends, it could take decades for students to fully catch up. Each district has a unique learning-loss trajectory, meaning that there is no one-size-fits-all recovery approach.",
            "However, most districts must also continue to juggle myriad other concerns relating to student behavior, health, and well-being, along with teacher retention and basic facilities maintenance, all of which require adequately addressing ongoing support and funding. And they need to address these concerns with still-limited funds: the $190 billion in ESSER stimulus funding allocated to US public schools over a five-year period amounts to an increase of less than 5 percent a year in total annual budgets, or only an additional $800 in funding per student each year on average.",
            " In districts where funding has fallen due to decreased enrollments, these additional funds barely fill in the gaps.",
            "ESSER stimulus funding alone is not enough to enable districts to adequately tackle student learning delays in addition to the historic and structural staffing shortages, decades of underinvestment in school infrastructure, record levels of student absenteeism, and declining student mental and physical well-being that many school districts face. Districts should strive to prioritize among these needs.",
            "The $90 billion in remaining federal stimulus funding presents both challenges and opportunities for school districts across the United States. Although the window for action is narrowing, there is sufficient time for districts to ensure that remaining ESSER funds are strategically allocated toward priorities that will improve student outcomes, address long-standing teacher and facilities challenges, and bolster the districtâs ability to weather estimated fiscal abnormalities.",

        "paragraphs": [
            "in the United States have returned to the classroom and to a semblance of a normal learning environment. Yet they continue to battle challenges related to the pandemic. Our analysis shows that nationwide, an estimated 17 million students have more than half a year of pandemic-related learning delay, 16 million students who need mental-health support are not receiving it, and 15 million students are chronically absent.",
            " These challenges are interconnected and mutually reinforcing: students who are not in a mental state conducive to learning or are simply not present in school cannot participate in learning recovery interventions. Therefore, the three challenges should likely be tackled togetherâand soon.",
            " existing bright spots related to todayâs challenges suggests that, theoretically, applying remaining Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER) funds strategically across proven interventions with fidelity at scale has the potential to recover 90 percent of learning delays wrought by the pandemic. However, 43 percent of the $190 billion in ESSER funds has already been spent, and an additional 15 percent has been budgeted.",
            " So it is likely that states and districts will need to plan for efforts that extend beyond the funds and time period of ESSER to help students fully recover.",
            "In doing so, schools and school systems may have the opportunity to embed new interventions and practices and to build implementation capacity that can not only address the challenges laid out in this article but also close long-standing opportunity gaps that have existed in the United States for decades.",
            "At the same time, districts are under extraordinary pressureâpressure to deliver results for students, many of whom have missed significant learning milestones, and pressure to do so with limited (and potentially diminishing) funds, with the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER) funding window closing by September 2024. As districts look hard at their budgets, they need to understand how to prioritize investments in proven interventions to address the interconnected challenges students are facing.",
            "Below, we outline these three challenges, examples of bright spots for each, and what it might take for states, districts, and philanthropies to scale interventions to reach a greater proportion of students in need (see sidebar, âLooking beyond ESSER to fund interventionsâ).",
            "Learning delays, diminished mental health, and absenteeism present real challenges for todayâs students. Schools have an opportunity to address them by applying lessons learned from existing bright spots.",
            "More than 17 million students nationwide have experienced more than half a year of pandemic-related learning delay (Exhibit 1).",
            " Without interventions to support their recovery, each student could lose an estimated $54,000 to $69,000 in lifetime earnings.",
            " Several states and districts have seen accelerated rates of learning recovery after adopting high-quality instructional materials (HQIM) and aligned professional development; providing high-quality, high-intensity tutoring",
            "; and extending the school year through summer or intensive-learning academies.",
            "HQIM paired with high-quality aligned professional development have demonstrated effectiveness in raising studentsâ state assessment scores. And given that HQIM are comparable in cost with low-efficacy materials (excluding the cost of switching), they are budget neutral. Nebraska and Louisiana saw significant improvements in their studentsâ math and reading scores after adopting high-quality curriculums. Nebraska used ESSER II funding to provide free access to Zearn Math, a digital learning platform, for all public and nonpublic elementary and middle schools.",
            " More than 9,000 educators in nearly 500 schools in Nebraska used Zearn Math in the 2020â21 and 2021â22 academic years. Students who used it consistently saw their math scores increase at up to 2.5 times the rate of students who did not.",
            " Louisiana, after using a portion of its ESSER funding to invest in HQIM in the way of literacy screeners and science of reading curriculums, saw an increase of more than two points in fourth-grade National Assessment of Educational Progress reading scores in 2022 compared with 2019 (in contrast to a three-point decline in national fourth-grade reading scores between 2019 and 2022). The state anticipates an increase of more than ten points by 2027.",
            "Meanwhile, districts across Tennessee and the Saint Paul Public Schools in Minnesota are seeing noticeable student academic gains as a result of high-quality tutoring. The State of Tennessee is addressing shortages of qualified tutors by releasing playbooks to help districts partner with community organizations to launch tutoring programs and provide tutors with training.",
            " About 50,000 Tennessee students participated in tutoring programs in the first year, resulting in one-third of a year of academic growth on average among students in kindergarten through second grade.",
            " Saint Paul Public Schools budgeted $1.8 million toward the WINN (What I Need Now) program, which pairs struggling elementary school students with top reading teachers. On average, third-grade WINN students have experienced a 60 percent increase in state assessment scores, compared with a 40 percent increase among nonparticipants.",
            "While we are still waiting on quantifiable postpandemic results from summer and intensive-learning academies, prepandemic efforts showed positive outcomes. For example, before the pandemic, Lawrence Public Schools in Massachusetts launched Acceleration Academies to provide supplemental intensive instruction and tutoring to students during school vacations, pairing struggling students with highly effective teachers in small-group settings (with a studentâteacher ratio of approximately ten to one). The program saw a 17 percent increase in median Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System math scores over the first three years.",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated preexisting mental-health challenges in youth. From 2020 to 2021, 42 percent of high school students reported experiencing persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, and 10 percent reported having attempted suicide (compared with 31 percent and 7 percent in 2017, respectively).",
            " Currently, an estimated 17.4 million Kâ12 students have mental-health needs, but only 1.1 million students could be served in school based on current mental-health provider capacity.",
            " This means more than 16 million students with mental-health needs are unserved in schools.",
            " While data is still emerging about mental-health needs in 2023, anecdotal evidence suggests that there has been limited improvement more than a year after students returned to fully in-person learning.",
            " Interventions in student mental health exist along a continuum, ranging from preventive supports offered to all students (tier one) to acute interventions offered to the subset of students in greatest need (tier three). Bright spots have emerged across this continuum.",
            "Evidence shows that increasing availability and access to mental-health services and trained professionals helps prevent avoidable mental-health crises. Pulaski County Schools in Kentucky implemented a universal screening tool pilot that identified an additional 16 percent of students who might need support and increased the number of school-based mental-health clinicians available to serve those students.",
            " And nearly 900 educators in San Antonio, Texas, have received mental-health first aid training to better support and determine student needs.",
            " Hawaii launched a telehealth effort, ensuring that the approximately 170,000 students in the stateâs 295 schools will have free access to virtual one-on-one mental-health counseling services.",
            "The State of California and Henry County in Georgia have both developed nontraditional mental-health support roles to mitigate the human capital challenge. Through the Wellness Coach Program in Californiaâs broader Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative, new or existing associate or bachelorâs degree holders can pair programs of study in education with 400 hours of structured behavioral-health field practicums. This program, which is set to begin in the fall of 2023 with a $360 million investment over five years, has the potential to expand the pipeline for mental-health professionals.",
            " Henry County has added one mental-health and -wellness facilitator to every school in the district. These individuals can support studentsâ mental health by teaching techniques for managing anger and anxiety, fostering connectivity, and other actions.",
            "As the period in which districts can supplement regular budgets with stimulus funding ends, Medicaid reimbursement for school mental-health supports could potentially help expand access. California has recently enacted policies in this vein that will reimburse school-based mental-healthcare costs for students enrolled in the stateâs Medi-Cal Managed Care plans.",
            "An estimated 15 million students were chronically absent during the 2021â22 school year.",
            " This means that approximately one in three students is missing at least one day every two weeks, representing a dramatic increase in the incidence of chronic absenteeism: an estimated eight million students were chronically absent from 2018 to 2019. And early evidence shows limited signs of this trend abating.",
            " Absenteeism can have significant repercussions: research from the Utah Education Policy Center finds that chronically absent students are 1.7 times less likely to meet grade-level standards for reading and 7.4 times more likely to drop out of school.",
            " According to our analysis, this puts roughly two million students on track to drop out before graduationânearly double the rate before the pandemic.",
            " While many factors that contribute to absenteeism may be outside schoolsâ control and results from efforts to curb absenteeism are still emerging, a few practices are showing promise for reengaging students.",
            "Some districts, including Baltimore City and Sacramento City, are exploring more transparent and actionable data practices. Under a shared-data agreement in Baltimore, child welfare workers monitored attendance data and were able to identify 700 children each month for more social services.",
            " And Sacramento City developed a new system that enabled the district to better track and analyze attendanceâand thereby identify students in need of intervention. Chronic absenteeism fell by an average of 2 percent in pilot schools.",
            "In Louisiana, districts have tackled chronic absenteeism through restorative wraparound practices, such as launching positive-messaging campaigns about attendance and adding staff dedicated to lowering absenteeism starting in summer 2021. Chronic absenteeism in the state went from 28 percent in the 2020â21 school year to 19 percent in the 2021â22 school year, inching closer to the rate of 16 percent seen before the pandemic.",
            "Increasing engagement with families may also help curb absenteeism. Connecticut lowered chronic absenteeism through home visits and personal engagement with families of students who were chronically absent or at elevated risk of becoming chronically absent, such as those transitioning from middle to high school.",
            " Fulton County, Georgia, sent thousands of text and mail nudges to families of students who were chronically absent or at-risk of being chronically absent during the 2020â21 school year and estimates that it prevented 8,000 to 18,000 absences across the district of 90,000 students.",
            "Here we focus on scaling bright-spot interventions in learning delay, given that this area currently has the broadest evidence base for the costs and effects of tested solutions. More research is needed to understand the investments necessary to scale mental-health and absenteeism interventions and to understand how to design comprehensive interventions that account for the interactions among learning, absenteeism, and mental health.",
            "Theoretically, absent time and human capital constraints, dedicating the full remaining ESSER funding toward high-quality, high-intensity tutoring could address pandemic-related learning delays for every student with more than nine weeks (a quarter of a year) of learning delay in 42 out of 50 states. However, the reality is that districts are unlikely to be able to hire enough tutors, schedule enough sessions, and administer programs on that scaleâand do so within the remaining months of ESSER.",
            "Addressing pandemic-related learning delays in the real world and for as many students as possible will require layering interventions.",
            "Addressing pandemic-related learning delays in the real world and for as many students as possible will require layering interventionsâHQIM, high-intensity tutoring, and summer learning. We consider three potential scenarios for layering interventions.",
            "Scaling existing bright-spot interventions nationally across these three learning interventions could address the pandemic-related learning delay of 57 percent of students within one year and still leave significant ESSER funds on the table (Exhibit 2).",
            "This would entail implementing HQIM for all students starting in the 2023â24 school year, offering summer learning to all students who need it, and offering high-intensity tutoring to about 8 percent of the Kâ12 population. However, this approach would not entirely close the learning gap: the remaining 43 percent, or 20.6 million students nationwide, would still have some pandemic-related learning delay.",
            "Closing the remaining gap within the ESSER\nbudget envelope and timeline would be possible\nonly if districts could roll out more-effective programs at a faster rate than we have seen to date.\nFor example, districts could address the full extent of pandemic-related learning delays if they doubled the effectiveness of existing summer learning (toward what was experienced in highly effective prepandemic vacation acceleration academies) and found the capacity to tutor an additional 13.6 million students. However, given existing district capacity constraints and the tight time frame, this goal would be very challenging to achieve.",
            "A more realistic and sustainable approach may be to embed practices into future budgets. Extending the recovery period from one year to two, providing an additional year of HQIM and aligned professional development for teachers, could address 83 percent of students with pandemic-related learning delays (Exhibit 3).",
            "While this approach would not reach 100 percent of students, it has the potential to be more sustainableâdespite the looming expiration of ESSER funds. Given that districts already include spending for instructional materials within their budgets, they need only bear the incremental cost of switching to HQIM.",
            " Schools could consider using current staff or community partners to provide tutoring capacity. And given that many districts already offer summer school, they may not need to build entirely new programs but rather could improve upon the existing infrastructure. In general, it will be important to focus on models that can be sustained without significant incremental funding. Districts could also consider replacing less effective interventions and reallocating budgets toward the above solutions.",
            "The challenges facing Kâ12 students in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic are complex and interrelated. However, there is hope in the emerging bright spots, which range from investments in human capital to innovations in learning and student support models. With layered and scaled interventions, districts could potentially address many of the learning delays attributed to the pandemic and start to narrow persistent learning gaps that predated it.",
            "Of course, significant barriers are likely to impede the implementation of these solutions. As districts, philanthropies, and private-sector actors work together to approach the theoretical recovery trajectories,",
            " they would be well advised to understand the full impact of their interventions and the extent to which they address studentsâ most pressing challenges. This understanding would support districts in embedding effective interventions in their repertoire, helping to close not only the pandemic-induced gaps but also the persistent educational-opportunity gaps that have existed for generations.",

        "description": "Mississippiâs former state superintendent of education shares how she achieved significant gains in student outcomes and discusses her hopes for the future of Mississippi schools.",
        "paragraphs": [
            "state superintendent of education in 2013, Mississippi had some of the lowest literacy scores of any state in the country. Teachers in the state were ill-prepared; the rollout of the new Common Core curriculum had gone poorly; and accountability was limited. And given that the state had one of the highest child poverty rates in the country and was continuing to face lawsuits over racial segregation in schools, the education system was not set up to serve all students equitably.",
            "Over the course of the next decade, Wright worked to steer Mississippi schools in a new direction, fueled by her strong belief in the untapped potential of the stateâs teachers and students. Two major pieces of legislation in 2013 laid the foundation for this change: the Literacy-Based Promotion Act, which put much more pressure on the Mississippi Department of Education and schools statewide to focus on early literacy, and the Early Learning Collaborative Act, which drove public funding to early education. Wright capitalized on these laws and led meaningful change within the stateâs education system by building deep relationships with community stakeholders, who became integral to the stateâs success.",
            "During Wrightâs tenure, Mississippi became one of the fastest-improving states in both literacy and math, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) (Exhibit 1). The state also made significant progress in closing the racial achievement gap.",
            "By the time she retired in 2022, Wright had served in her role for three times as long as the average state education leader and left a transformed state education system. In an interview with McKinseyâs Emma Dorn, Carey Wright shared how she maintained longevity in her role, changed the culture of low expectations, and overcame common implementation challenges to see significant improvements in student performance.",
            " Tell me about the state of the education system you inherited when you took the top job in 2013.",
            " We were literally ranked 50th in the country and had been for years. There was a culture of low expectations for children and adults. Our standards had been evaluated by two outside organizations; one referred to them as âhorrendous,â and the other referred to them as âthe worst in the nation.â",
            "The department was not organized well. We had just passed the Literacy-Based Promotion Act and the Early Learning Collaborative Act. But there was no early-childhood department, and no one was really leading the literacy effort. There was no chief of operations. After Iâd been there for six months, I realized we didnât have enough professionals to get this job done.",
            "There was no strategic plan at all. I think the legislature had been trying to legislate education by passing law after law, but legislative change wasnât translating into change in the classroom. Education really wasnât a high priority for them, even though we had been at the bottom for years. It felt like people had become resigned to failure and had given up trying to actually change student outcomes.",
            " What was it like stepping into that environment?",
            " When the headhunting firm called me for this job, I had never really thought about being a state chief. But I thought, âYou know what? Let me give this a shot.â You have to understand where I came from. I had been in two of the highest-performing school districts in the nation: Montgomery County Public Schools and Howard County Public Schools, both in Maryland. After that, I was in Washington, DC, and we had done some pretty amazing work there.",
            " I had the advantage of knowing what excellence looked like from my experience in Maryland, and I was able to take that lens to DC and identify the fundamental things that need to take place in a school district. That gave me the confidence to go to Mississippi.",
            "I was unanimously picked by the Mississippi State Board of Education to lead this work, which shocked the state initially because I wasnât from Mississippi and I was a woman. Theyâd never had a woman as the state chief before. Those two issues reared their heads very early on, but I didnât let them limit what I could achieve.",
            " How did you approach changing the culture and raising expectations?",
            " My chief of staff told me that there are some folks in this state who donât believe in all children succeeding. He was referring to Mississippiâs history of racial segregation, which needs to be acknowledged. That was part of what we had to change. I was very emphatic with folks that we werenât just talking about kids in only some zip codes. All kids in Mississippi needed to improve.",
            "That whole first year, I had more breakfasts, lunches, and dinners than Iâve ever had in my entire life. This is the deep, red South. Relationships matter in most places, but here they really, really matter. So people got to know me.",
            "It started with having the support of the board and maintaining relationships with key people in the legislature: the appropriations chairs, the education chairs, the speaker, the lieutenant governor. The people who make things happen. Other key players in the communityâMississippi First, the Barksdale Reading Institute, the Mississippi Economic Councilâare part of that coalition, too.",
            "Then, in the first six to eight months, I got to know the current leadership and quickly realized that many people were not on board. Luckily, they realized that I was going to be driving hard and decided to back out of their own volition rather than me having to politely ask them to leave.",
            "We also had a very limited communications team, which, to me, was a real deficit. Youâve got to be proactive about your communication and whatâs happening in the districtâand we werenât. We were in a reactive state.",
            "So I assembled the best chiefs to lead each department, and I shifted the whole mantra to âWeâre going to start shining lights.â Anything around the state that was working well, we were going to highlight it. We started live streaming our Board of Education meetings, which was not done before. Our board became a teachable moment for the public, for the legislature. And we shifted the board meeting agendas to focus on our six goalsâon what was important for students and instruction.",
            "I assembled the best chiefs to lead each department, and I shifted the whole mantra to âWeâre going to start shining lights.â",
            " Weâve heard a lot from your team about the six goals you had. Tell me about how you landed on them and how you disseminated those goals across the entire state.",
            " Iâve lived by the philosophy that if everything is a priority, then nothing is. Instead of trying to fix everything, we had to focus on student achievement. For me, there was no equivocation. We had to do something for the children of this state and make sure that they were starting to learn at a high level. We needed goals that were simple; that everybody could understand.",
            "If everything is a priority, then nothing is. Instead of trying to fix everything, we had to focus on student achievement.",
            "We first came up with five goals related to achievement: proficiency growth, graduating students from high school, early-childhood education, capacity building for our teachers and leaders, and world-class data systems. The board met and added a sixth goal around every school and district meeting a basic bar. In that process, the board members really took ownership of the goals and pushed them out as their own, which made a big difference. We then started meeting with districts across the state to encourage them to align with our goals to make work easier. At the time, we had 151 districts, and a lot of them jumped on board. It was the first time the state of Mississippi ever had a goal for early-childhood education. And the state department had never really prioritized teacher professional development or capacity building before.",
            "Next, we developed a strategic plan that was simple and that everybody could understand. We kept the board regularly updated on the development of the plan and our actions. We couldnât tell the districts how to spend their money, but we could encourage them to lean into what we know works to keep improving. We also kept focused on what the public was going to hear and what our messaging was. I did the same thing with the legislature and did a lot of press availability.",
            "However, it wasnât enough to communicate the goalsâwe had to support districts to actually implement them. We leaned hard into what was important to guide our districts. We trained every kindergarten through third-grade general-education teacher, special-education teacher, and elementary administrator in the science of reading. We did the same thing with math. We needed them speaking the same language and doing the same things. We never backed off from that.",
            "The other key decision that we made to ensure quality was hiring every single professional-development coach in Mississippi who was out in the field. Coaches were put through a rigorous interview process to make sure they had the right background knowledge and knew how to work with adults. We were strategic in how we deployed these people and how we built capacity for teachers and leaders.",
            " I can imagine there was significant pushback from superintendents, principals, and teachers who felt like some of these things were their job. How did you navigate that? How did you bring all those people along with you?",
            " Initially, we put the coaches in the schools that had the worst data across the state. Iâll never forget when one principal said, âI donât need a coach.â And my response was, âDid you look at your data?â But the teachers thought having a coach was amazing. Then the rumors started going around the state, and everybody wanted a coach.",
            "Another change that people resisted was that we eliminated all courses at high schools that were below grade level. Our standards became the most rigorous these kids had ever had. And people thought, âThis is going to be their downfall.â But children can achieve at high levels if you give them the support to get there. We were determined that these kids were going to get access and opportunity.",
            "I also had a very large teacher advisory council, and I listened to the members. I think they recognized that we were invested in them as much as we were invested in the children. Any time we could highlight teachers and leaders across the state, we did. Thatâs where the magic happens: in the classroom. It doesnât happen at the Mississippi Department of Education.",
            " And how did you bring the board and the Department of Education along?",
            " When I was called to a budget meeting with the board, I spent the first 15 to 20 slides talking about return on investment. Theyâre all in business, so I told them, âYou gave me $15 million for the Literacy-Based Promotion Act. Hereâs your return on investment.â I then went through all the data, which showed we were continuing to climb.",
            "When the NAEP scores came out, we were number one in the nation for our gains in fourth-grade math and fourth-grade reading, third in the nation for our gains in eighth-grade math, and fourth for eighth-grade reading. Our children of poverty, be they Black, Hispanic, or White, outperformed all their counterparts nationally [Exhibit 2]. That became a huge talking point for us and gave people hope.",
            "Did I have my haters? Of course. But we marched on. When people around the state started seeing the scores come up, they realized that our kids could do this. Itâs hard to say something bad about somebody who is always open to conversation and who produces results year after year.",
            " How did your priorities shift over time as Mississippi climbed the rankings and the education system began to improve?",
            " We kept our eyes on the data to see what else we could be improving. When we saw that participation in advanced placement [AP] courses was low, we prioritized a statewide AP initiative and more than doubled the number of courses offered. Some doubters thought that scores would drop if we put these kids into AP. Well, not if you support the teachers and the children in those classes. We maintained and then kept increasing our pass rate. The two groups that benefited the most from the initiative were Hispanic and African American students. A child who takes just one AP class has a higher success rate in college.",
            "We kept our eyes on the data to see what else we could be improving. . . . We also listened to and attended to our teachers and students.",
            "We also listened to and attended to our teachers and students. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we also began focusing on the social and emotional well-being of teachers, leaders, and students because we heard loud and clear that mental health was a huge, huge priority.",
            " What do you think about the future of education in Mississippi? What needs to happen next to continue accelerating the progress that youâve made serving students in the state?",
            " To start with, there are some priorities that need to be sustained. We need to hold true to providing ongoing teacher professional development and leader capacity building. Because new teachers and leaders are coming into the system all the time. Mississippi needs to continue to expand early-childhood education, particularly for children in poverty. Mississippi has the highest rate of poverty in the nation. Kids who have received early-childhood education are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college, get a well-paying job, and have less involvement with drugs and the police.",
            "Then there are some priorities that need to evolve. Now that the NAEP results have shown the devastating impact of the pandemic on mathematics, Iâm hoping the state will take a close look and prioritize professional development for math. Another area that we need to address is career technical education. We could be forging more partnerships and work-based internships. Thatâs going to require thinking a bit differently about education.",
            "Last, social and emotional learning play a critical part in learning. You cannot learn if you are depressed; you cannot learn if you donât feel safe; and you cannot learn if you donât feel equipped to solve problems. We have to be thinking not just about the childrenâs academics but also about what their life is like. We have to ask ourselves how we can lift some of these children out of abject poverty. To me, education is the way to do that. There is nothing more important than making sure that kids are learning.",
            " If you were giving advice to a new state superintendent who wants to see the kind of gains that Mississippi has experienced, what would be your reflections for them?",
            "Youâve got to, in your heart of hearts, believe that thereâs nothing children canât do with the right amount of access and opportunity and support.",
            " Itâs a team effort. You canât do this job alone. And youâve got to persevere. I can literally look you in the face and say I had absolutely no social life for nine years. I did nothing but work, but I was determined, and I loved every minute of it. Youâve got to, in your heart of hearts, believe that thereâs nothing children canât do with the right amount of access and opportunity and support. And youâve got to convey that to the children and to their teachers and school leaders. That, in the end, is the North Star.",

            " And there are resources available to jump-start initiatives. The Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER) allocated $190 billion in federal funding to the nationâs schools, from prekindergarten (pre-K) to 12th gradeâa resource pool that could be used to advance racial-equity investments in education. But the clock is ticking: the funds must be obligated by September 2024.",

            "Based on detailed reviews of research and case studies, we have identified six actions that leaders of school systems and their communities could take to use the remaining ESSER funding to advance racial equity in education (exhibit).",
            " While this list is not exhaustive, these select areas include those in which students of color may have less access, lower quality, or fewer resources. Some of these solutions may not be novel, but our experience has shown that consistent implementation of these actions, and implementation at scale, has been a challenge thus far.",
            "To be clear, these actions, even if taken at scale, may not eliminate racial disparities in pre-Kâ12 education. However, evidence suggests that these investments could help shift current trajectories for education opportunities and outcomes, generating meaningful advances in equity.",
            "The opportunity gap in public education between White students and students of color has persisted throughout our nationâs history. When free public education began to spread in the early 19th century, children of color were often excluded. When they did gain access, they were often segregated and underserved.",
            " Forced segregation was permissible until the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision in 1954, and despite decades of court-ordered desegregation that followed, 98 percent of Black children in the South still attended segregated schools in 1964.",
            " And children of color were often forced to attend segregated schools with a focus on assimilation.",
            " progress has been made to narrow racial inequities in outcomes in all grades in math and reading.",
            " National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) scores show that on average, scores of Hispanic and Black students rose significantly relative to other student groups in the â70s and early â80s, and that Black or Hispanic children were roughly three years ahead of their parentsâ generation in math and two to three years ahead in reading.",
            " Over a similar time period, high school attainment levels rose steadily for Black students.",
            "However, meaningful progress in accelerating outcomes for students of color has stalled, leaving large gaps of roughly 0.6 to 0.8 standard deviations compared with White students.",
            " Black studentsâ test scores are, on average, around 2.0 grade levels lower than those of White students within the same districts, and the difference between Hispanic and White studentsâ average test scores in the same district is about 1.5 grades.",
            " These gaps emerge early in childrenâs lives: White kindergartners have higher math and reading skills than Black and Hispanic kindergartners as they enter school,",
            " and this discrepancy persists, leaving Black and Hispanic students with high school graduation rates four to six percentage points below the national average.",
            "While some states have made progress in increasing educational equity for students of color, most states only closed the gap by about 0.05 to 0.10 standard deviations between 2003 and 2012,",
            " suggesting that it would have taken 60 to 160 years for the nation to achieve education parity for students of color at prepandemic rates.",
            "Moreover, because of the effects of the pandemic, those gaps have widened (exhibit).",
            " In majority-Black schools, students are five months behind their historical levels in both math and reading, on average. Meanwhile, students in majority-White schools are just two months behind their historical levels.",
            "Through the 1970s and â80s, racial inequities in academic outcomes were closing, but there is still a long way to go. At the pace of change before the COVID-19 pandemic, it would take an estimated 60 to 160 years for students of color to achieve educational parity in the United States (see sidebar âRacial gaps in educational outcomes over timeâ).",
            " And the pandemic, which wiped out two decadesâ worth of math and reading progress for the nationâs fourth and eighth graders, exacerbated existing gaps.",
            " Declines in National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) math scores were much larger for Black students than for their White peers.",
            "While strong literacy instruction benefits all students, it could have an outsize impact on closing racial gaps. Struggling readers are disproportionately students of color.",
            "These developments, and the availability of federal funding to combat pandemic-related learning delays, offer an opportunity for action.",
            "Below are three actions school systems can control directly to help close equity gaps, as well as steps they could take to jump-start initiatives.",
            "Early literacy is closely linked to student success. Students who do not read proficiently by third grade are four times less likely to graduate from high school.",
            " While strong literacy instruction benefits all students, it could have an outsize impact on closing racial gaps. Struggling readers are disproportionately students of color; for example, of the one million fourth graders who do not read at a proficient level, two-thirds are Black or Hispanic.",
            "Research on tens of thousands of children and adults summarized by the National Center on Teacher Quality (NCTQ) provides a road map to potentially reduce the rate of reading failure from three in ten children to one in ten.",
            " This road map includes a strong phonics curriculum and intervention, paired with vocabulary and background knowledge gleaned from broad exposure to varied content.",
            " School systems have achieved significant growth in early-literacy results by implementing research-backed actions.",
            "Starting in 2013, Mississippi passed a series of state laws that overhauled the stateâs approach to teaching reading, aligning it with research-backed literacy practices. Between 2017 and 2019, it was the only state to see fourth-grade literacy gains on the NAEP, with Black studentsâ scores improving at a faster pace than those of their White peers.",
            " Other states are now following a similar strategy: in 2021, Louisiana proposed investments and passed legislation focused on early literacy, and in 2020, Tennessee passed legislation focused on foundational literacy skills.",
            " ESSER investments can help jump-start efforts to strengthen approaches to early-literacy instruction. To ensure those funds deliver maximum impact, system leaders could start by assessing the degree to which current literacy practices are backed by research. This could lead to curricular changes, new approaches to professional development, or other adjustments that could strengthen literacy instruction for students of color. States could also consider taking on a stronger role in overseeing teacher prep programs, which are currently largely outside their purview; requiring professional development that is aligned with curriculums and research; and publishing standards for state-approved curriculums and assessments.",
            "Resources such as staff, time, and money are limited and often concentrated on students from wealthier (usually White) families.",
            " Nationally, historically underserved students receive between $400 and $1,200 less per pupil than White and economically advantaged students.",
            " Students of color are also more likely to attend schools with newer, less experienced, lower-paid teachers, who are less effective than more-experienced teachers, on average.",
            "Multiple case studies suggest that when resources are targeted at low-income students and students of color, achievement gaps narrow.",
            " For example, a $1,000 increase in per-pupil funding over four years was found to boost college attendance rates by about three percentage points and graduation rates for lower-income students by nearly two percentage points.",
            "Research also suggests that students assigned to higher-quality teachers are more likely to graduate, attend college, and earn higher wages.",
            " Given that school systems across the country are currently struggling to attract and retain Kâ12 teachers,",
            " states could allocate ESSER funds to strategically address teacher shortages in hard-to-staff schools by using pay incentives. The NCTQ has identified 66 districts across the United States that are doing this.",
            " In assessing teacher staffing across districts, schools systems could also consider the diversity of their teaching staff. Research has shown that same-race teachers have a notable positive effect on the performance of students of color, including documented improvements in student achievement,",
            " school attendance,",
            " student self-management,",
            " course grades,",
            " high school graduation,",
            " and reduced disciplinary actions.",
            " System leaders could start by assessing whether resources are allocated with equity of opportunity in mind. This includes examining the distribution of the most effective staff, the impact of instructional and operational vacancies, facilities equity, per-pupil spend, and shared central resources. An equity framework could inform conversations about the best ways to allocate high-quality teachers and leaders to schools where they can have the greatest impact as well as other strategies to shift resources to ensure equity of opportunity.",
            "Research indicates tutoring can have a significant impact on student learning at scale,",
            " making it a potentially effective approach for combating pandemic-related learning loss to advance racial equity in education. A study by the University of Chicago found that individualized, intensive (âhigh dosageâ) tutoring could more than double the amount of math students learned in a single academic year.",
            "School systems can explore many tutoring programs, such as Saga Education, Reading Partners, and the Minnesota Math Corps.",
            " As school systems work to establish these programs, state leaders could also help by providing dedicated funding and technical assistance. For example, Tennessee recently launched TN All Corps, a program designed to provide funding and support to systems running high-dosage, low-ratio tutoring programs, and more than half the districts in the state are participating.",
            " ESSER resources provide an opportunity to increase instructional time for students of color who need additional support. State leaders could consider replicating efforts like Tennesseeâs to provide incentives for and build momentum around high-dosage tutoring.",
            "Advancing racial equity in education also means addressing factors that are outside of school systemsâ direct control. To help close gaps in education opportunity and outcomes, community leaders could take the following three actions in partnership with school system leaders.",
            "Research shows that children enrolled in pre-K programs typically go on to achieve higher test scores and better language development. Often, they also have better attendance and fewer behavioral problems in school.",
            " Moreover, the positive effects of pre-K are often larger for students of color, particularly Hispanic students and those from low-income households.",
            " Research suggests that attending a high-quality pre-K program can close as much as 50 percent of the racial achievement gap.",
            "But racial disparities exist today in both enrollment and access to high-quality programming.",
            " To reduce these gaps, school systems could consider investing in high-quality pre-K and ensuring access for children of color.",
            " School systems could convene state and local leaders, district and charter leaders, childcare providers, parents, advocates, workforce partners, and others to develop a road map to expand high-quality pre-K with a focus on racial equity. And if doing so requires a new revenue source, the assembled stakeholders could help build a coalition to identify potential funding mechanisms. Some states and localities have used short-term federal funds to pilot expanded pre-K programs, though other funding sources will likely be needed to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "Factors that affect long-term outcomes for youth, such as stable affordable housing and exposure to traumatic events, are beyond the direct control of the school system. Children who have experienced a single adverse childhood experience earn 7.3 percent less than their peers and are more likely to depend on public benefits and live in poverty.",
            " Wraparound healthcare, social services, and other supports are thus considered critical complements to a strong school. This is particularly important for students of color. McKinsey research has found that many Black neighborhoods are consumer deserts, with inadequate access to food, affordable housing, healthcare services, broadband, and banks.",
            "Harlem Childrenâs Zone (HCZ) provides an example of what can be achieved by combining strong schools with effective community support. Educator Geoffrey Canada created HCZ in 1997 to address challenges children in Harlem were facing through what HCZ calls âcradle-to-career servicesâ centered on education,",
            " including parent workshops, full-day preschool, health clinics, youth violence prevention efforts, and college admissions support. HCZ played a central role in connecting services across schools, local government, and community organizations. HCZâs work was credited with eliminating gaps in outcomes between students of color and White students in both literacy and math.",
            "Numerous efforts have been made to replicate HCZâs success, including through the Obama administrationâs Promise Neighborhoods initiative. Launched in 2010, the initiative has awarded grants to 17 cities, but results have been mixedâan outcome some researchers say highlights the difficulty of measuring success and shows how varied needs can be from one community to another.",
            " In Buffalo, the Say Yes to Education program saw graduation rates climb 15 points from 2012 (the starting year of operations) to 2017. The program includes the promise of free college tuition for graduates and provides a full suite of wraparound services for students. Leaders highlight cooperation from local government, schools, the teachersâ union, parents, business groups, and higher education as instrumental to Buffaloâs success.",
            "The Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative (DSNI) in Boston is another example of a neighborhood collaborative that has supported community-led initiatives to increase affordable housing and strengthen community infrastructure.",
            " HCZ, the Say Yes program, and DSNI have relied on partnerships with a broad base of funders that have made long-term commitments.",
            " School systems with large populations of students of color living in neighborhoods that are consumer deserts could begin by identifying a leader who can build a community and school system coalition organized around long-term collaborative commitments to strengthen the community. As the coalition builds momentum, its focus could turn to ensuring sufficient funding over the long term.",
            "Longitudinal studies of court-ordered desegregation in the 1950s and 1960s found that five years in an integrated school environment translated into a 14.5-percentage-point increase in the likelihood of Black students graduating from high school.",
            " More recently, an analysis of NAEP results showed that low-income students in high-poverty schools were about two years of learning behind low-income students attending more-affluent schools.",
            " And itâs not just historically marginalized students who benefit from attending more-affluent schools (which tend to have a higher proportion of White students than low-income schools do): students of all races and socioeconomic statuses show improvements in critical thinking, motivation, creativity, and problem-solving skills in socioeconomically diverse classrooms.",
            "Yet nearly 70 years after Brown v. Board of Education, the nationâs schools remain divided along racial, ethnic, and economic lines, despite student populations becoming increasingly diverse.",
            " For instance, one in six US public-school students attends a school where more than 90 percent of students share that studentâs racial identity.",
            " The US Government Accountability Office found that there are 13,500 predominantly same-race schools within ten miles of a predominantly same-race school of a different race.",
            "Some schools and communities around the country are trying to address this issue by focusing on socioeconomic integration.",
            " The Century Foundation estimates that more than 900 districts have some form of integration policy in place today.",
            " Across these efforts, successful approaches have had support and investment from both district leadership and the broader community to help guide efforts as they evolve over time.",
            "In Dallas and San Antonio, school district leaders worked with communities to identify new school models that would be compelling to parents across all socioeconomic groups, such as science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) programs; dual-language schools; and advanced-learning opportunities.",
            " These new schools are diverse by designâwhen they opened, slots were prioritized for students from different socioeconomic groups.",
            " Initial results suggest these schools have more-representative student bodies and bring positive academic benefits to students.",
            " school systems and communities are focusing on socioeconomics in an effort to diversify schools. Case studies of Dallas, San Antonio, and New York City show a variety of ways to address the issue.",
            "In Dallas, racial segregation and concentrated poverty have traditionally gone hand in hand, limiting resources and supports for schools in communities of color.",
            " Starting in 2014, the city opened some new schools and transformed others to include options that families indicated would be more appealing. The city put new admissions policies in place at these new schools, reserving half of the slots for students from one of the cityâs economically disadvantaged communities and half for students from more-affluent communities. Transportation was provided to mitigate barriers to attendance.",
            "Examples are emerging of newer schools that are far more representative of Dallasâs overall population, both racially and socioeconomically, than the average Dallas public school.",
            " But the benefits extend beyond just school composition: the âdiverse by designâ schools have stronger student attendance and teacher retention than average and are increasingly popular with families.",
            "In San Antonio, the lowest-performing schools were often located in the cityâs highest-poverty communities. When city leaders first considered how to better support the most vulnerable students, they started with granular data analysis, mapping indicators of poverty on a block-by-block basis. Using this data, leaders sorted students into four socioeconomic groups (called âblocksâ) based on the level of disadvantage they were facing. Then, as the district opened new schools in 2017 with attractive magnet programs, leaders intentionally set aside seats for students from all four blocks, particularly focusing on the students in Block Fourâthose with the greatest economic hurdles.",
            "San Antonio paired the rollout of its integration program with an initiative to bring strong educators to historically low-performing schools. With these two efforts combined, the number of students in schools deemed failing by the state dropped by 400 percent, and in 2018, San Antonio was considered the fastest-improving school system in Texas.",
            "New York Cityâs District 15 served a socioeconomically and racially diverse population within a relatively contiguous geographic area, but in very segregated schools. For years, community leaders and elected officials pushed for action on integration.",
            " A formal planning process finally kicked off in 2017, endorsed by the district but led by a working group of community members and supported by an external facilitator.",
            " Parents were invited to weigh in at public workshops and given meaningful support to participate, including real-time translation, travel vouchers, childcare, and food.",
            "Under the plan the working group developed, which was then ratified by the New York City Department of Education, academic screening for middle school admissions in District 15 was eliminated, and all schools set aside more than half of seats for historically disadvantaged students. The working group also advocated for additional resources to ensure schools would be equitable and inclusive, including training for staff, changes to curriculums, and restorative-justice practices.",
            "The new policy was implemented in 2018. By July 2020, economic segregation in sixth grade had decreased by 55 percent, while racial segregation decreased by 38 percent.",
            " In the first year of the program, there was no discernable White flight; in fact, the overall racial composition of the district remained the same.",
            "In New York Cityâs District 15, a community school district encompassing affluent brownstone Brooklyn and lower-income and immigrant enclaves, a community-driven process led to a controlled-choice admissions plan for middle school. Since its launch in 2018, this plan has decreased economic and racial segregation (see sidebar âCase studies in socioeconomic integrationâ).",
            " The path forward for socioeconomic integrationâand racial integration by proxyâoften depends on local context and requires a long-term vision for implementation. System leaders could start by studying the enrollment and demographic patterns in their community to understand the challenge and the opportunity. They could then partner with local groups to understand what kind of change families might support and listen to perspectives from all stakeholders to build a coalition for change. Districts could use federal funds to spur planning and engagement efforts, which often require real resources to be successful and inclusive.",
            "The lack of meaningful progress in closing racial disparities in pre-Kâ12 educational outcomes, and the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on learning for students of color, suggests that policy makers need to think differently about how to close these gaps. At the same time, collective community energy around addressing pandemic recovery and the resources provided by ESSER represent a unique opportunity for school system leaders to address racial inequities. To seize that opportunity, leaders could consider translating a vision for equity into meaningful actions such as the six described here, with broader community commitment for long-term initiatives.",

        "description": "Germany has been a leader in the transition toward a low-carbon-energy system, but it will still miss most of its energy-transition targets for 2020. Urgent action is needed to get back on track.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " Germany was a pioneer in climate protection and perceived as a global role model for a successful energy transition. As early as in 2000, Germany implemented the Renewable Energy Sources Act, which supported the large-scale buildup of renewables under an expensive feed-in tariff scheme. As a result, installed solar-photovoltaic (PV) and wind capacities have soared from 6.2 gigawatts to 83.8 gigawatts between 2000 and 2015. During this time, Germany accounted for 33 percent of the renewable buildup within the European Union. In addition, the policy has led to the creation of a considerable âgreenâ industry: German companies used to be global champions in the production of solar-PV cells as well as wind turbines, developing cutting-edge technologies and creating jobs for several-hundred-thousand employees.",
            " the development of the German energy transition since 2012, with an âEnergy Transition Index.â The index is composed of 15 indicators along the three dimensions of energy supply: environmental sustainability, security of supply, and economic development and growthâthe so-called âenergy triangle.â Indicators record the extent to which each politically defined energy-transition target is achieved, and thus if Germanyâs energy transition in each area is well on track, if it requires minor adjustment, or if the target achievement is seriously off track.",
            "Based on this impressive trajectory, Germany set itself ambitious targets to further accelerate the energy transition. According to the plans of the federal government, significant progress in the transition to less carbon-intensive and yet still secure and affordable energy supply should be achieved by 2020. With this milestone year approaching, it is time for a comprehensive progress review. Todayâs necessary message is clear: the country misses key targets. (For more on the research underlying this article, see sidebar, âThe German Energy Transition Index.â) Recent course-correction efforts by the federal government have not yet been far-reaching enough to bring lasting improvements. Meanwhile, problems are emerging in all three dimensions of the âenergy triangle.â These recent struggles in Germany illustrate the potential pitfalls of a fast energy transition, but they can provide important lessons for other countries endeavoring on their energy transition.",
            "On the core issue of environmental sustainability, the energy transition is lagging far behind its 2020 targets. In 2018, 866 million tons of CO",
            " equivalents (CO",
            "e) in emissions were released. While this amount represents a 4.5 percent drop from the previous year, it was still 116 million tons above the target of 750 million tons for 2020. The improvement seen last year, which was temporary and largely due to weather conditions, does not change the long-term trend. If the pace of emission reduction from the past decade continues, Germany will hit its 2020 targets eight years late, and will only meet those for 2030 in 2046.",
            "The Energy Transition Index reflects this sluggish progress. At no point since the indexâs inception has the intermediate CO",
            "e emission target been met 100 percent, and currently this indicator stands at 61 percent. Indicators of primary energy consumption and electricity consumption also show low levels of target achievementâ57 percent and 39 percent, respectively. The likelihood of reaching these targets by 2020 is therefore classified as âseriously off track.â Furthermore, the extent to which electricity-consumption targets are met has been falling since 2014 (Exhibit 1).",
            "The main reason is that to date nearly all CO",
            "e savings stem from efforts in the electricity sector, where emission reductions are primarily due to the expansion of renewable-energy sources, along with the decommissioning of older conventional power plants and the surcharge for CO",
            " within the European emission-trading system. In the first half of 2019, electricity-sector emissions were about 15 percent lower than they were during the same period in 2018. According to the German Association of Energy and Water Industries, this drop was caused by record generation from renewable sources, a higher price for CO",
            ", and mild weather conditions. The amount of electricity generated from renewable sources has surpassed the 2020 target (35 percent of total gross electricity consumption) since 2016. Currently target achievement for this indicator is 144 percent.",
            "However, the electricity sectorâs progress has not yet been replicated in the transportation, building, or industry sectors. In the transportation sector, emissions increased from 153 million tons to 162 million tons of CO",
            "e (an increase of 6 percent) since 2012. The rise in passenger vehicle traffic (increase by 5 percent) more than offset the reduction in emissions per kilometer driven (decrease by 3 percent), resulting in a negative balance overall. In the industry sector, CO",
            "e emissions increased from 180 million tons to 196 million tons (increase by 9 percent). Finally, emissions fell in the building sector, but only from 130 million tons to 117 million tons of CO",
            "eâa drop of just 10 percent.",
            "Substantially lowering CO",
            "e emissions will not only require further action to increase energy efficiency but also a higher level of sector couplingâin other words, comprehensive electrification of the transportation, building, and industrial sectors. In this way, these sectors can fully benefit from energy sources, such as wind- and solar-power systems, that do not generate CO",
            "e. Despite the importance of sector coupling, the Energy Transition Index does not yet provide a quantitative value for the sector-coupling indicator, because no overarching targets had been clearly formulated for this area.",
            "Germany has enjoyed a highly secure electricity supply for decades, but the tide is beginning to turn. The German power grid repeatedly faced critical situations in June of this year: significant shortfalls in available power were detected on three separate days. At its peak, the gap between supply and demand reached six gigawattsâequivalent to the output of six major power plants. Imports arranged on short notice from surrounding countries were required to stabilize the grid. Also, the price for balancing energy jumped to â¬37,856 per megawatt-hour in one instance. In 2017, the price for balancing energy averaged â¬63.90 per megawatt-hour. While this can be interpreted as an indicator of shortage, initial investigation has shown that changes in how balancing-energy prices are calculated and that trading behavior also played a role in this steep increase. Grid operators have already announced that they will review the enormous price fluctuations and their causes.",
            "The supply situation will become even more challenging in the future. The phaseout of nuclear power until the end of 2022, and the planned reduction of coal-fired generation, will gradually shut down further secured capacity. If new generation facilities are not added, the reserve margin will tumble, with consequences that vary considerably from one region to the next. Industrial areas in western and southern Germany will be hit especially hard, as large drains on capacity exist in these regions and high rates of renewable expansion are unlikely there. Furthermore, the shift from dispatchable capacity to fluctuating renewable sources could also lead to problems in situations when demand is high but supply from renewable energy is low.",
            "The loss of generation capacity has another effect as well: Germany will almost certainly go from being a net electricity exporter to an importer, especially after 2023. In June 2019, the country imported more power than it exported for the first time in five years. However, some neighboring countries are also decommissioning power plants. The Netherlands is phasing out coal, for example, and discussions in Belgium about stopping the use of nuclear power may also result in plant closures. In the medium term, the European network as a whole could lack sufficient generation capacity.",
            "In light of this, expanding Germanyâs electricity grid becomes increasingly crucial to transmitting electricity produced by the large wind capacities in the north to the demand centers in the south. Faster progress is essential to ensure the countryâs energy supply. By the first quarter of 2019, just 1,087 kilometers of the 3,600-kilometer transmission lines planned for that date were actually completed. If grid expansion continues at this pace, the country will not reach its 2020 target until 2037. The recently adopted Grid Expansion Acceleration Act is a step in the right direction, but the backlog will not be eliminated anytime soon. Grid expansion will become even more important from 2023 onward, when a larger transmission system will be crucial to counteract the regional bottlenecks expected after the last nuclear plants are shut down and the first steps to phase out coal generation take place.",
            "Current indicators of the security of supply reflect these problems. As just 36 percent of the transmission-grid-expansion target has been reached, the likelihood of hitting this target remains classified as âseriously off track.â No updated values are available for interconnector capacity; based on the last value calculatedâ89 percentâthis indicator remains in the âminor adjustment requiredâ category. The target for the cost of grid interventions, an indicator of transmission-system stability, has been met to 42 percent, so hitting this target is considered âseriously off trackâ as well. Whatâs more, intervention for redispatching and feed-in management has increased significantly since 2016. In contrast, hitting the targets for power outages and secured reserve margin is considered âon track,â as indicators for both have been over 100 percent for several years (Exhibit 2).",
            "At the same time, the planned decommissioning of nuclear and coal-fired plants could soon dramatically change the reserve margin. In their current system-balance report, the transmission-system operators predict that the reserve margin will be negativeâindicating a lack of secured powerâas early as 2021. This gap will amount to 5.5 gigawatts even before accounting for the shutdown of coal-fired plants in the course of the German coal exit. A slightly positive reserve margin of 1.1 gigawatts is achieved only under the assumption that the 6.6 gigawatts of grid reserve are extended beyond 2020. From that point until 2023, at least 17.7 gigawatts of the remaining secured output will disappear as the last nuclear plants go offline and coal-fired plants follow. If peak load remains the same, the balance gap will grow to 16.6 gigawatts unless new generation capacity is added.",
            "Economic development and growth have long constituted a problematic area for energy transitionâespecially when it comes to electricity-price development. For years, German consumers have paid more for their electricity than their European neighbors do. Today the electricity price for households is still about 45 percent above the European average. As a result, target achievement for this indicator is just 25 percent, so the likelihood of hitting this target remains classified as âseriously off track.â Conversely, the electricity price for industry continues to follow the positive trend that began in 2014, and target achievement for this indicator is 127 percent. However, the electricity price used in this analysis only applies to companies that are partially exempt from the Renewable Energy Act levy (Exhibit 3).",
            "The high price of household electricity is mostly due to taxes and fees, which rose by 17 percent since 2012, even as costs for procurement and sales fell by 16 percent. The Renewable Energy Act levyâwhich increased from 3.6 eurocents per kilowatt-hour to 6.4 cents per kilowatt-hourâis a particular challenge for Germany. As a result, the level of target achievement is just 17 percent, relegating this indicator to the âseriously off trackâ category. Overall, levies account for 54 percent of the price of household electricity in Germanyâfar higher than the European average of 37 percent. Costs for grid expansion and interventions also add to the German electricity price; fees for grid usage have reached 7.4 eurocents per kilowatt-hour, up 20 percent since 2012.",
            "The Energy Transition Index does point to positive developments in the labor market. Thanks to the overall good employment situation in Germany, the target for jobs in energy-intensive industries has been exceeded (reaching 141 percent). The most recent figure for the indicator for jobs in renewable energies is 105 percent. In both cases, the targets have been surpassed for years. However, the current struggles of the German wind-energy industry, as one example, suggest a negative outlook.",
            "In Germany, frustration is now growing among the general population over the lack of progress in addressing climate change. The âFridays for Futureâ school strikes and the good results of the Green Party in the European election are signs of broad public interest in climate protection. Pressure on the federal government is rising. It has become clear that small adjustments are not enough to get the energy transition back on track.",
            "In September 2019, therefore, the German government agreed on a concept to reach the goal of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 55 percent until 2030 with annual reduction targets per sector. Several ministries had worked for months on proposals for this âclimate package.â In order to ensure compliance, the reduction efforts shall be objectively monitored by an external board of experts. More than 50 measures are planned now to help accelerate the cut in emissions and keep costs under control: starting in 2021, a national CO",
            " price will be implemented on emissions from the building and transport sector, complementing the existing European Emission Trading System. Furthermore, citizens will be financially compensated by lowered electricity prices, increased support payments for commuters, higher housing allowances, and tax reductions for using public transportâthatâs the plan.",
            "Although there is broad agreement that this climate-action concept is a step in the right direction, most observers consider the proposed measures as not efficient enough to reach the reconfirmed emission-reduction target of â55 percent by 2030. The biggest criticism: the CO",
            " price levels are not strong enough to induce sufficient shifts in customer behavior and investments. Furthermore, the concept does not address all challenges of the decarbonization pathway until 2030 as identified already in the Energy Transition Index. For example, while on sector coupling the concept defines specific targets in the mobility sector (7 millionâ10 million electric vehicles until 2030), other sector targets remain vague, for instance, with regard to buildings and heat.",
            "Regarding energy efficiency, critics complain about a lack of a holistic perspective on the target contribution of energy-efficiency measuresâand so the government has announced ",
            "Â an energy-efficiency strategy 2050 by the end of the year. One challenge in developing this strategy is that while financial support for energy-efficiency measures shall increase, it is unclear to what extent the measures will contribute to reducing energy consumption. At least electricity consumption can be expected to increase further, despite efficiency initiatives, due to further advances in electrification.",
            "Objectively, too, it can be stated that these measures do not sufficiently address the security of supply concerns in Germany, as it relies on overcapacities in the European electricity system. However, as dispatchable capacity decreases across European countries, it is certain that further action is needed to secure Germanyâs energy supply in the medium to long term and to prevent the high macroeconomic costs of potential bottlenecks. In particular, four additional types of action at the federal-government level should be considered: first, grid extensions need to be accelerated to enable the integration of more renewable power. Second, capacity for peak loads should be expanded to compensate for the secured capacity that will be eliminated, or existing backup capacity should be maintained until compensation is online. Third, to secure supply in the short term, Germany could enter into contractual agreements with foreign power plants to provide power when domestic supply bottlenecks occur. However, as other countries also plan to shut down secured capacity, such agreements can only serve as a temporary solution with limited scope. Fourth, demand management should be expanded to further mitigate supply bottlenecks; this tool will become more relevant in the coming years as nuclear and coal power is phased out.",
            "The necessary move away from coal-fired power generation to renewable energy poses major challenges for all countries worldwide. Germany was one of the first countries to formulate ambitious national goals for its energy transition. Today, it can be said that Germany will miss most of its energy-transition targets for 2020. However, energy transition remains a process. To get back on track now, the federal government needs to put the recently announced climate program into action, in an effective and timely manner, and it needs to consider further measures. There is still a chance for Germany to remain a pioneer in climate protection. And, there is an external âmotivationâ for the country to succeed: based on current EU regulation, the country could be obliged to make compensation payments if EU targets are breached continuously. Already, in the federal budget for 2020 to 2022, â¬300 million has been reserved for the purchase of missing CO",
            " pollution rights from other EU states. The energy think tank Agora estimates that penalties could add up to â¬30 billion to â¬60 billion over the next decade. Thatâs money taxpayers would have to spend if no countermeasures are taken.",

As more low-carbon materials become available to end consumers, especially in Europe, these premiums are expected to decline.",

            "In some locations, incumbents are exploring retrofits to existing assets, which can make sense where transport and storage capacity is available, along with needed space on existing plants. In addition, CCUS-enabled lower-carbon clinker could become more widespread with the construction of new net-zero megaplants in advantaged markets. Such markets include areas in the United States with cheap renewable power and IRA support, as well as locations in Europe with renewable resources, CO",

Players may need to restructure their asset strategies to benefit from the advantages of these markets while continuing to serve their existing markets. This might involve producing lower-carbon clinker in megaplants and then shipping it to local markets and grinding it there. Beyond choosing markets to enter, cement players can also benefit from economies of scale by using AI in logistics and leveraging larger plants (ranging from four million to six million metric tons per year). Strategically built megaplants could potentially reduce production costs for lower-carbon clinker by up to 60 percent, making it a more economically viable option (Exhibit 1).",

Admixtures also allow for greater levels of concrete recycling and the use of fiber reinforcement.",
            "However, a few obstacles currently hinder the widespread adoption of admixtures. Different concrete applications require different types of admixtures, and incorporating different concrete mixtures can make construction more complex to plan and execute. In addition, key stakeholders may have limited awareness about the decarbonization potential of admixtures. In markets in which cement assets offer significant returns, there is also a transition challenge for integrated incumbents, which will need to disrupt their own business models to increase admixtures in ready-mix concrete (RMC).",
            "Alternative cementitious materials, such as low-carbon cement or geopolymer concrete, have historically struggled to scale. However, current investment trends and rapid technological advancements have allowed start-ups to disrupt the alternative-cementitious space with low-carbon offerings. For example, Brimstone replaces limestone in traditional cement production with calcium-silicate rock, and Sublime Systems uses an electrochemical process that eliminates the need for a kiln. Although these approaches are novel, investment data indicates that appetite for alternative cementitious materials is high: Brimstone announced a $55 million funding round in 2022, and Sublime Systems has raised more than $40 million in two funding rounds since 2021.",
            "Local markets play a strong role in shaping the supply and demand of different cementitious products, making global trends somewhat difficult to predict. However, some general trajectories are expected in the coming years (exhibit).",
            " Demand for traditional clinker is expected to shrink as the construction market increases its requirements for sustainable materials. Traditional-clinker production is expected to shrink as well, since some production facilities will be retrofitted with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology to make lower-carbon clinker. Margins are expected to remain stable or fluctuate only slightly, depending on local conditions.",
            " CCUS-enabled lower-carbon clinker is expected to increase in both demand and supply (from zero today),",
            " but ultimately it will be limited to production in markets with advantaged access to CO",
            " sinks, raw materials, government support, and renewable power. This will likely entail excess demand and could enable lower-carbon-clinker producers to charge a premium. A 2021 McKinsey survey found that two-thirds of developers and contractors expected these premiums to materialize, but it is still too early to estimate their size. The cost of lower-carbon-clinker production could be up to 45 percent higher than that of traditional clinker,",
            " but this cost premium could be significantly reduced for megaplants in advantaged markets producing lower-carbon clinker at scale.",
            " Traditional SCMs, such as granulated blast-furnace slag and fly ash, are traditionally sourced from heavy industries (iron and steel plants and coal-fired plants, respectively). Although these SCMs are increasing in value, their supply is expected to continue to decrease as heavy industries decarbonize. This could lead to higher margins and push sourcing strategies further offshore.",
            " Our analysis suggests that SCMs produced through novel processes will benefit from increased demand and a cost advantage over CCUS-enabled lower-carbon clinker, and the potential for high margins is expected to drive investment. Players will need to ensure access to these new materials early on to avoid missing out.",
            "In particular, supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) offer promising ways to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of traditional cement and concrete. Traditional SCMsâsuch as fly ash, ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS), and silica fumeâcan be used to partially replace the clinker used in cement or the cement content used in concrete. This can have both sustainability and cost benefits, but SCMs are typically not fully leveraged. In many markets, local and regional standards limit the volume of traditional SCMs in cement based on their hydraulic and cementitious properties. For example, the European Union limits fly ash to a maximum of 35 percent, whereas the United States limits it to 40 percent.",
            " New SCMs such as calcined clay, limestone, and recycled concrete may require a reevaluation of these standards to maximize both the performance and decarbonization potential of cement and concrete, particularly as the availability of traditional SCMs decreases (see sidebar, âMarket projections for cementitious offeringsâ).",
            "Circular economies aim to minimize the environmental impact of concrete by using less virgin cementâand therefore less clinkerâin its production.",
            " To boost circularity, cement and concrete players can use strategies such as reusing concrete waste and incorporating recycled materials in new-concrete production.",
            "With increased materials circularity, owning demolition, waste streams, and separation technologies will become increasingly important compared with owning a kiln, todayâs main control point. As a result, new players such as start-ups focused on waste stream management and infrastructure companies overseeing waste from construction projects are entering the cementitious space. However, waste transportation and processing pose logistical challenges, limiting scalability and making waste value chains highly localized.",
            "Although these four pathways are complementary, they will compete for growth and investment, and the pace at which they are adopted may differ markedly across markets. Down the value chain, new admixtures and recycling could create great value, although recycling is difficult to scale. Cement players in the middle will need to balance CCUS-driven lower-carbon clinker and innovative cementitious solutions to achieve near- and long-term success as different technologies mature. Their choices will be driven by cost and facilitated by regulators, industry organizations, and specifiers building pathways toward decarbonization.",
            "In the years to come, cementitious producers and providers of solutions and services will need to choose which strategies and business models they wish to implement in the pursuit of net-zero cement. Our analysis has identified nine potential future business models for cementitious producers and solution providers, ranging from entirely new approaches to minor adjustments to the status quo. Most of these business models are anchored around a specific solution that is tailored to respond to a specific need. At the same time, many of these business models are complementary and can be combined for greater decarbonization.",
            "As the industry decarbonizes, a new landscape of cementitious producers could emerge to compete for market share:",
            "As cementitious producers navigate the materials transition, other forward-thinking players will be able to find business opportunities supporting them. These solutions providers could offer lower-carbon clinker, fillers, and special cement blends, which will be critical for retrofitted low-carbon cement producers. These offerings could reduce the cost of decarbonization on the cement and concrete manufacturing side while enabling maximum performance of the materials and the lowest CO",
            " footprint possible.",
            "As players innovate tailored solutions to meet customer needs, a number of cementitious-solutions providers could emerge:",
            "The jury is still out on which of these paths or business models will win, but several clear messages emerge for cement industry players and solution providers.",
            "In the energy transition, incumbents will need to navigate between CCUS and cementitious-driven approaches, using a combination of technologies to meet decarbonization goals and to hedge their bets on which recipe will win in the long run. Depending on their strategy, incumbents can take steps to secure sources for traditional SCMs and greener materials, or they can innovate or acquire new SCMs. Incumbents also have greater freedom to invest in lower-carbon clinker megaplants, which could prove to be a powerful advantage in the future.",
            "Meanwhile, disruptors such as solutions and service providers can leverage data and analytics to help end customers manage the materials transition.",
            " Innovators can leverage technology partnerships to develop new SCMs and admixtures in cement and concrete. These new SCMs could potentially be used in higher shares, winning both volume and margin advantages and potentially leading to new performance-based pricing arrangements, because less volume could achieve the same value. Regulatory positioning and certification will be key in these efforts.",
            "To reach net zero, the cement industry will need to engage in active efforts. This will be a real transformation from past ways of operating, and the time to start building this muscle is now. If incumbents and disruptors can invest strategically in innovative technologies and business models, they could be well positioned to lead in the industry landscape to come.",

        "paragraphs": [
            "will be foundational in the effort to limit climate change. In effect, the energy transition is a commodities transitionâmetals and minerals are critical inputs for low-carbon technologies such as wind turbines and electric vehicles (EVs). Their importance is reflected in the rapid growth of commodity trading pools, which nearly doubled year over year, reaching close to $100 billion in 2022 (Exhibit 1).",
            " Further, metals and minerals are poised to make up an increasing share of the value pool in the coming years.",
            "The market is characterized by a significant imbalance. For some commodities, such as copper, lithium, and boron, supply will fall well short of demand by 2030.",
            " Inadequate capital expenditures and delays in bringing new capacity online are likely to contribute to price spikes and to inject uncertainty and volatility into the markets. Meanwhile, rising protectionism, geopolitical disruptions, and concentrated supply chains could disrupt trade flows and give rise to regional markets.",
            "The move from hydrocarbons to low-carbon energy sources will create opportunities in the long term. Yet players that wait for liquidity as markets develop will find their options limited. Producers, traders, and big energy companies can take actions to develop new capabilities, expand into different parts of the value chain, and pursue new opportunities. Their actions could also support the energy transition by ensuring capital flows to increase supply and build out infrastructure.",
            "Divergent trends in demand and supply have created a substantial misalignment over the long term that could threaten the energy transitionâs progress.",
            "Reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 will require a transition to clean and low-carbon sources of energy. To support continued economic growth during this period, the resource base will have to double. That could require nearly $200 trillion in investment through 2050 for EVs, upgraded power grids, and low-carbon power.",
            "Metals and minerals will be in greater demand because lower-carbon technologies typically require more of these materials than conventional energy sources (Exhibit 2). An offshore wind turbine requires 15 times the mineral inputs to produce an equivalent amount of power versus a natural-gas installation, while battery EVs are 15 to 20 percent heavier, on average, than internal-combustion-engine automobiles. In 2030, battery EVs and the associated charging infrastructure will consume upwards of 50 percent of rare earth elements, 55 percent of cobalt, and 36 percent of nickel.",
            "Spurring investment is crucial because supply is projected to fall well short in the coming decades. Several factors could constrain capacity.",
            " Long before the energy transition became a strategic priority for countries around the world, China was taking prescient action to position itself as a dominant player. In 1992, Chinese premier Deng Xiaoping reportedly remarked, âWhile the Middle East has oil, China dominates rare earths.â Its share of production reached a high of 98 percent of global supply in 2009.",
            " China also established supply chains for other minerals in clean energy and now processes more than 40 percent of materials across most categories, putting itself in an advantageous position as a net exporter.",
            "From a geographic standpoint, Chinaâs concentration of clean-energy supply chains and scale means the countryâs plans for the years ahead could have an outsize impact on the market. Similarly, emerging electro statesâfor example, Australia (lithium), Chile (copper), the Democratic Republic of Congo (cobalt), and Indonesia (nickel)âcould influence the market for their respective minerals (Exhibit 3).",
            "Geostrategic bottlenecks have begun to emerge. For example, Chile, the second-largest producer of lithium, announced plans to nationalize its reserves.",
            " Indonesiaâs government leaders have instituted limits on nickel exports, a move felt especially in the European Union. Over the long term, countries could seek to use their mineral and metal production to gain a geopolitical advantage and build local industry and employment, a trend that could contribute to more regionalization.",
            "This high level of concentration is counterbalanced by an increasingly regionalized regulatory landscape. Other countries will likely seek to establish their own clean-energy supply chains (for example, through the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States or similar policies in the European Union), thereby creating a more dynamic market environment.",
            " Funding exploration projects to identify previously unknown reserves will be critical to the marketâs evolution. But at a time when huge levels of investment will be needed, the landscape has become more challenging. Rising interest rates and decreased availability of financing means producers will have to pay a premium to secure funding for capital expenditures, which could hinder their ability to take advantage of new opportunities.",
            "Aligning new capital expenditure projects with market demand has always been a challenge because of longer lead times for bringing new capacity online. For example, the average mine takes five to 15 years to become operational (depending on material and project characteristics),",
            " a timeline that assumes no issues with permitting; no environmental, social, and governance (ESG) objections; and no water stress, among other issues. Many of the proposed mines involve new technologies deployed by relatively inexperienced companies, so delays in production and scaling are likely. Some new mine projects planned today wouldnât start producing until around 2040. Since mines can require a huge amount of hydrocarbon energy (depending on the project and commodity), they are likely to come under heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public, potentially delaying their progress further.",
            " Minerals critical to the transition, such as lithium in EV batteries, are in such demand because they are currently the only option for certain clean-energy sources. Reuse could address a portion of demand: the International Energy Agency estimates recycling could account for 10 percent of supply for minerals such as copper, lithium, and nickel by 2040.",
            " However, the first generation of renewable technologies must be built before such minerals can be recycled.",
            "Amid inadequate supply of selected commodities to support the energy transition, research and innovation could increase overall supply by ramping up the production of suitable alternatives. The battery sector offers a helpful point of reference. The growth of batteries containing high amounts of nickel resulted in price spikes as customers sought to secure a steady supply. Battery producers and OEMs responded by prioritizing optionality. For example, manganese is a possible alternative and has global production that is four to five times greater than that of nickel.",
            " Toyotaâs recent announcement of a breakthrough in its development of a solid-state battery reinforces the potential of innovation to significantly shift demand for minerals.",
            "Similarly, the rise of competing technologies such as sustainable liquid fuels, which donât require the same amount of infrastructure spending, could fill the gap in the energy transition. In general, the global economy will reward pathways that offer alternatives to scarce materials; once those pathways are established, there is no going back.",
            "The divergent trajectories in supply and demand are projected to create significant long-term deficits in commodities. Indeed, across a range of minerals and rare earth metals, McKinsey analysis of two different scenariosâa base case and a high caseâindicates that supply is dwarfed by the collective demand from the energy transition and other uses through 2030 (Exhibit 4).",
            "Despite the critical need for more investment, investors have favored other sectors (such as technology and healthcare) over the past several cycles, expanding the underfunding gap and creating a more urgent need for action. Commodities remain mispriced and, in fact, are often being shorted as a recession hedge, a repeat of the strategy investors commonly used in 2008. Today, the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index is only just starting to rebound from all-time lows versus the S&P 500 (Exhibit 5).",
            "In the face of rising long-term demand, commodities players have incentives to focus on short-term strategies. Since 2012, mining companies have trimmed capital expenditures, with sector spending in aggregate falling to around $40 billion in 2022, despite the recent uptick from 2020 lows. Rather than allocating funds for capital expenditures, companies are putting money into dividends and stock buybacks. M&A has also become an attractive option, particularly in mining.",
            "The energy sector is taking a similar approach: with free cash flow yields at an all-time high, both oil and gas and renewables companies are opting for debt repayment and dividends over capital investment (Exhibit 6).",
            "In the years ahead, the metals and minerals markets will be complex and uncertain. Shifting supply and demand, technological advancements, and regulatory compliance will all affect the global marketâs trajectory. Companies can take targeted actions now to shore up their position and prepare to pursue new opportunities.",
            "As we have discussed previously, the energy transition is redefining the commodity asset class.",
            " New offerings could be differentiated by geography, production methods, regulatory treatment, and environmental impact. Opportunities include the following:",
            "Another priority will be building a strong origination function to improve market access through more sophisticated marketing and trading functions. The increased fragmentation and deglobalization across several markets will make price formation and discovery more complex. For example, nickel sulphate dominates the delivered market but has become fully disconnected from the London Metal Exchange (LME) Nickel benchmark price, pushing metals players to conduct independent price discovery. Being active across the value chain will help metals players manage increasing macroeconomic and geopolitical risk.",
            "Traders can play a critical role in addressing the commodities challenge by focusing on three core areas. First, they could support the development of liquidity and price discovery in rapidly evolving metals and minerals markets. In addition, traders could provide products tailored to each marketâs ESG specifications. They can also enhance their risk management capabilities to provide these services for established and new counterparties entering these markets for the first time. Last, by drawing on their capital, traders can help to directly address the supply gap (for example, accelerating asset development by providing prefinancing to junior mines).",
            "As markets take shape, traders could become more active in adjacent areas, such as offering logistics solutions (for example, helping lithium producers gain access to markets). Their understanding of the full value chain could enable them to play a more active role in origination and M&A. Further, an in-depth understanding of cross-commodity dynamicsâsuch as the interplay between natural gas, ammonia, and bunker fuelâcould allow traders to anticipate substitutes in a given value pool.",
            "The energy transition will be accompanied by a trilemma: how to ensure energy continues to be available, affordable, and sustainable. These three interrelated factors will require major energy players to play a fundamental role in providing traditional energy sources to ensure sufficient supply while mineral and metals production ramps up.",
            "To remain competitive and replace the shrinking oil and gas margin pool over the coming decades, players will need to expand activities beyond their role in maintaining the existing supply base into new parts of the value chain. For example, several supermajors have already achieved scale in power markets and biofuels. We also expect to see energy players use their expertise to expand into metals and minerals to capture margins tied to the volatility in the energy transition. For example, ExxonMobil recently acquired drilling rights in land believed to be rich in lithium in the southern United States, giving the company access to a critical component for EV batteries.",
            "The energy transition will drive an unprecedented growth in demand for metals and minerals that underpin key transition technologies. However, supply faces structural constraints to bring on new investment, to scale substitutes, and to navigate concentrated supply-chain bottlenecks, resulting in a long-term deficit in critical commodities.",
            "This shortfall presents an exceptional set of opportunities. Metals producers, traders, and a broader set of energy players could unlock new sources of supply, provide critical commercial services (such as price discovery) to an increasingly sophisticated group of customers and counterparties, and maintain the existing supply base of traditional energy sources to support a relatively orderly transition.",

            "This, however, is changing fast: strong demand for infrastructure, a shortage of skilled labor, and increased stakeholder pressure for data transparency and integration are all accelerating digital adoption. As a result, the AEC tech ecosystem has experienced an explosion of investment and a wave of start-up launches. An estimated $50 billion was invested in AEC tech between 2020 to 2022, 85 percent higher than the previous three years. During the same period, the number of deals in the industry increased 30 percent to 1,229 (Exhibit 1).",
            "Although the AEC tech industry is maturing, it is not yet at the scale and sophistication of more established software markets like logistics, manufacturing, and agriculture. The industry boasts fewer scale-ups and unicorns relative to its size. And it is hard for AEC tech companies to grow efficiently due to several dynamics among AEC customers, including fragmentation, low IT spend (relative to other industries), and entrenched analog ways of working. ",
            "In this environment, how can AEC tech companies accelerate adoption and sales and achieve scale? To answer this question, we surveyed approximately 100 investors and AEC tech players in 2022 and interviewed founders, investors, and large software companies in the industry. Using primary research and publicly available data, we also mapped and analyzed more than 3,000 AEC tech companies.",
            " In this article, we review the findings of that research. We outline the investment trends that are accelerating the digitization of the industry, and we suggest how tech businesses, and their investors, can address challenges to get on a path of efficient growth.",
            "Digitization of the AEC industry started gathering steam a decade ago, but the pace has accelerated over the past three yearsâand a number of trends suggest it will continue to do so (see sidebar, âWhat do we mean by architecture, engineering, and construction tech?â).",

It includes design software, robotics, and tools for the planning, scheduling, budgeting, and performance management of projects (exhibit). Companies in the AEC tech industry range from multibillion-dollar software giants to one-person start-ups.",
            "A combination of supply-and-demand factors are prompting investment in AEC tech. On one hand, global demand for long-term construction is strong, in part because of increased stimulus by governments, such as the $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in the United States and the â¬800 billion NextGenerationEU fund in Europe. More asset owners are also investing sizeable capital to ",

For example, the United Kingdomâs Building Safety Act requires a digital ledger of all building data for new residential buildings, and Swedenâs ID06 requires digital records of all the construction workers on a construction site. ",
            "Investment in AEC tech has grown multifold and, based on our research, more and more investors are recognizing AEC techâs potential to fundamentally change the structure of the construction industry and redistribute value pools at scale. This momentum is likely to continue. Seventy-seven percent of the respondents to our survey expect to invest in AEC tech at similar or higher levels in 2023, and 64 percent see it generating higher returns versus other verticals. ",

Indeed, nearly half of the companies we analyzed offer customers solutions that address three or more use cases. ",
            "Until now, AEC tech and property technology (proptech) have evolved as separate ecosystems. AEC tech has focused on the design and construction of assets, while proptech has focused on the financing, planning, operation, and maintenance aspects of assets. This is starting to change, as customers and technology players see value in connecting the two. Our analysis shows that 20 percent of AEC tech companies also address at least one proptech use case: for example, linking the design and operation of building management systems using a digital twin.",
            "While the trends above have helped expand the ecosystem of AEC-focused tech businesses and start-ups, investors and founders still wonder how best to pursue efficient growthâdefined as the ability to grow annual recurring revenues (ARR) and to generate free cash flow (FCF) from those revenues.",

We are looking for founders with vision and mission to improve outcomes for big swathes of the market.â Having a bold visionâand being able to effectively articulate how it benefits the user and the broader industryâhelps attract talent, investors, and customers, and allows companies to move faster as they continually course-correct toward a North Star. For example, one AEC tech company focuses on improving predictability of project outcomes and uses that simple vision to expand the total addressable market (TAM) beyond contractors and planners to cover a far broader customer set, including project owners, banks, and insurance companies.",
            "A bold vision usually means founders are thinking about the entire AEC tech ecosystem and figuring out ways in which their company can work with other providers to create a seamless user experience and unlock newfound value for a broader set of customers. For example, one AEC design platform expanded its core offering beyond architects and engineers to connect to product suppliers, and thus monetize transactions for building products used in designs.",
            "Finding the right product market fit is a key part of the investment decision-making process for investors in most industries, but AEC tech companies often do not get it right. In fact, as our survey indicates, the most common issues observed by AEC tech investors are an overfocus on engineering (rather than product and market fit) and product fragmentation (Exhibit 5).",
            "As one AEC tech player noted, âNiche, technical design tools are often built by self-taught developers and construction professionals who built the tool to solve a specific problem or fill a gap in their workflow. As such, the very nature of those tools focuses on the tech and not the user experience.â In our discussions with start-ups and investors, three common themes emerged that can help create a better product market fit.

Since customer needs differ across segments, companies would do well to focus on one or a few specific segments, whether they are targeting architects or subcontractors or distributors. As one founder put it, âI have potential customers in manufacturing, retail, construction, and facilities management across more than ten geographies, but we have to focus, or we will achieve nothing.â",
            "Second is feedback. As one investor told us, âMany contech [construction technology] firms are founded by industry professionals who launched their business to solve a problem, so they have huge product focus. We need to see more founders with a balanced product and market/customer focus.â One way to sharpen market focus is to build a network of customers and collaborators. Most successful players do this through their investorsâ networks and beta customers, who benefit from low-cost early releases in return for investment in testing and development feedback. And a side benefit is that they can provide access to a critical mass of other customers (Exhibit 6).",
            "Third is flexibility. Nearly every start-up and scale-up we have spoken to has seen a big shift in their product proposition because they responded to market views and kept evolving to optimize the product market fit. For example, one start-up developed an app to measure material waste from construction sites but eventually evolved it to measure embodied carbon in materials. ",
            "Valuations for start-ups are tied strongly with the ARR growth metric. In a fragmented market like AEC, customer acquisition is difficult and expensive. Based on our research, leading players differentiate themselves with three moves to maximize the ARR bang for each buck spent on marketing and R&D:",
            "Our analysis shows that as software companies grow, the most important driver of valuation shifts from pure growth, often measured by ARR, to include the ability to generate FCF from ARR. In short, itâs not enough to just have customers; you need to earn money from them. In what is commonly ",
            "Â to as the ârule of 40,â the sum of percentage growth and the FCF rate should equal 40 percent or higher.",
            "Achieving strong FCF is in large part about optimizing the payback periodâthat is, how long does it take to recover your customer acquisition costs. This means acquiring new customers efficiently, retaining customers, and upselling and cross-selling to them. This is measured by net retention rate (NRR),",
            " which requires a laser focus on customer success. Across sectors, companies with high NRRs demonstrate three common characteristics:",
            "As software companies grow beyond the start-up and scale-up stages, growth rates slow, and FCF (and hence, valuation) is increasingly driven by operational efficiency. This typically comes down to optimizing NRR as well as marketing and sales spend (which can be 50 percent or more of the revenues of typical software companies). At-scale software companies in the top quartile for valuation typically exhibit the following characteristics",

To capitalize on the investment opportunities and achieve efficient growth, investors and tech companies can learn from the most successful AEC tech companies and catch the wave in this exciting industry.",

            " The majority of these emissions are Scope 3, meaning they originate either with suppliers or from using and operating the built environment.",

In this article, we outline how procurement can deliver on its dual mission of improving profitability and driving decarbonization, and we recommend actions for chief procurement officers (CPOs) and other leaders across the value chain who want to take a proactive stance as the industry transitions.",
            "Procurement plays an important role in construction, typically accounting for 40 to 70 percent of a companyâs total spending, and industry executives see the function as a trusted business partner.",

            "Recent McKinsey research highlights how the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have had a significant impact on commodity prices and supply chains.",
            " This can already be seen in rising inflation around the world. For example, in 2022, most countries grappled with year-over-year inflation of more than 5 percent. And although the duration and impact of todayâs rates of inflation are unknown, they are certain to put additional pressure on constructionâs profitability.",
            "Despite the significant margin impact of procurement, the construction industry is not keeping up with other industries when it comes to implementing best practices (exhibit). This is partially explained by external challengesâsuch as limited control over project specifications and complex, fragmented supply chainsâand internal challenges such as decentralized project-by-project mindsets.",
            "Some construction companies have been able to overcome these challenges and develop group- or nationwide sourcing strategies that capture significant savings potential. Those with best-in-class procurement practices actively contribute to improving their companiesâ financial results, with margins that are sometimes five to ten percentage points higher than those of procurement laggards.",

            "In addition to playing a key role in improving profitability in volatile and inflationary times, procurement will likely play an even greater role in decarbonizing construction. Given that 90 percent of the emissions from construction companies are Scope 3,",

            "Longer-term or strategic levers will center on securing access to green materials. Anticipating where future shortages of materials will occur and securing access to supply in the long term will require strategic decision making and demand forecasting far beyond current project pipelines. Increasing integration with suppliersâvia supplier development, demand, and capacity planning, as well as helping suppliers decarbonize their energy useâwill continue to be relevant, but it will likely not suffice. The level of scarcity of certain materials may require construction companies to invest in, fully acquire, or build new suppliers to secure access, as the auto industry had to do when automotive OEMs invested in green-steel start-ups in Europe and the United States.",

The past few months have also brought their share of upsets, including liquidity woes and some bank failures. But, broadly speaking, a favorable wind seems to have returned to the industryâs sails. The past 18 months have been the best period for global banking overall since at least 2007, as rising interest rates have boosted profits in a more benign credit environment.",

            ", representing views from McKinseyâs Global Banking Practice.",
            "Below the surface, too, much has changed: balance sheet and transactions have increasingly moved out of traditional banks to nontraditional institutions and to parts of the market that are capital-light and often differently regulatedâfor example, to digital payments specialists and private markets, including alternative asset management firms. While the growth of assets under management outside of banksâ balance sheets is not new, our analysis suggests that the traditional core of the banking sectorâthe balance sheetânow finds itself at a tipping point. Given the size of this movement, we have broadened the scope of this yearâs Global Banking Annual Review to define banks as including all financial institutions except insurance companies.",
            "In this yearâs review, we focus on this âGreat Banking Transition,â analyzing causes and effects and considering whether the improved performance in 2022â23 and the recent rise in interest rates in many economies could change its dynamics. To conclude, we suggest five priorities for financial institutions as they look to reinvent and future-proof themselves. The five are: exploiting leading technologies (including AI), flexing and potentially even unbundling the balance sheet, scaling or exiting transaction business, leveling up distribution, and adapting to the evolving risk landscape.",
            "All financial institutions will need to examine each of their businesses to assess where their competitive advantages lie across and within the three core banking activities of balance sheet, transactions, and distribution. And they will need to do so in a world in which technology and AI will play a more prominent role, and against the backdrop of a shifting macroeconomic environment and heightened geopolitical risks.",
            "The recent upturn arises from the sharp increase in interest rates in many advanced economies, including a 500-basis-point rise in the United States. The higher interest rates enabled a long-awaited improvement in net interest margins, which boosted the sectorâs profits by about $280 billion in 2022 and lifted return on equity (ROE) to 12 percent in 2022 and an expected 13 percent in 2023, compared with an average of just 9 percent since 2010 (Exhibit 1).",
            "Over the past year, the banking sector has continued its journey of continuous cost improvement: the cost-income ratio dropped by seven percentage points from 59 percent in 2012 to about 52 percent in 2022 (partially driven by margin changes), and the trend is also visible in the cost-per-asset ratio (which declined from 1.6 to 1.5).",
            "The ROE growth was accompanied by volatility over the past 18 months. This contributed to the collapse or rescue of high-profile banks in the United States and the government-brokered takeover of one of Switzerlandâs oldest and biggest banks. Star performers of past years, including fintechs and cryptocurrency players, have struggled against this backdrop.",
            "Performance varied widely within categories. While some financial institutions across markets have generated a premium ROE, strong growth in earnings, and above-average price-to-earnings and price-to-book multiples, others have lagged (Exhibit 2). While more than 40 percent of payments providers have an ROE above 14 percent, almost 35 percent have an ROE below 8 percent. Among wealth and asset managers, who typically have margins of about 30 percent, more than one-third have an ROE above 14 percent, while more than 40 percent have an ROE below 8 percent. Bank performance varies significantly, too. These variations indicate the extent to which operational excellence and decisions relating to cost, efficiency, customer retention, and other issues affecting performance are more important than ever for banking. Strongest performers tend to use the balance sheet effectively, are customer centric, and often lead on technology usage.",
            "Between 2017 and 2022, payment providers, capital market infrastructure providers, and asset managers, as well asÂ investment banks and brokers-dealers increased their price to earnings, whereas other financial institutions including GSIB (global systematically important banks), universal banks, and nonbank lendersÂ saw a decline in their price to earnings.",
            "Payment providers, investment banks and broker dealers also increased their earnings per share more than the other types of institutions. Consequently, these two types of institutions come out best in terms of value creation and total return to shareholders among financial institutions during this five-year period.",
            "The geographic divergence we have noted in previous years also continues to widen. Banks grouped along the crescent formed by the Indian Ocean, stretching from Singapore to India, Dubai, and parts of eastern Africa, are home to half of the best-performing banks in the world (Exhibit 3). In other geographies, many banks buoyed by recent performance are able to invest again. But in Europe and the United States, as well as in China and Russia, banks overall have struggled to generate their cost of capital.",
            "One aspect of banking hasnât changed, however: the price-to-book ratio, which was at 0.9 in 2022. This measure has remained flat since the 2008 financial crisis and stands at a historic gap to the rest of the economyâa reflection that capital markets expect the duration-weighted return on equity to remain below the cost of equity. While the price-to-book ratio reflects some of the long-term systematic challenges the sector is facing, it also suggests the possible upside: every 0.1-times improvement in the price-to-book ratio would cause the sectorâs value added to increase by more than $1 trillion.",
            "Looking to the future, the outlook for financial institutions is likely to be especially shaped by four global trends. First, the macroeconomic environment has shifted substantially, with higher interest rates and inflation figures in many parts of the world, as well as a possible deceleration of Chinese economic growth. An unusually broad range of outcomes is suddenly possible, suggesting we may be on the cusp of a new macroeconomic era. Second, technological progress continues to accelerate, and customers are increasingly comfortable with and demanding about technology-driven experiences. In particular, the emergence of generative AI could be a game changer, lifting productivity by 3 to 5 percent and enabling a reduction in operating expenditures of between $200 billion and $300 billion, according to our estimates. Third, governments are broadening and deepening regulatory scrutiny of nontraditional financial institutions and intermediaries as the macroeconomic system comes under stress and new technologies, players, and risks emerge. For example, recently published proposals for a final Basel III âendgameâ would result in higher capital requirements for large and medium-size banks, with differences across banks. And fourth, systemic risk is shifting in nature as rising geopolitical tensions increase volatility and spur restrictions on trade and investment in the real economy.",
            "In this context, the future dynamics of the Great Transition are critical for the banking sector overall.\nEvidence of the transitionâs profound effect on the sector to date abounds. For example, between 2015 and 2022, more than 70 percent of the net increase of financial funds ended up off banking balance sheets, held by insurance and pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds, private capital, and other alternative investments, as well as retail and institutional investors (Exhibit 4).",
            "The shift off the balance sheet is a global phenomenon (Exhibit 5). In the United States, 75 percent of the net increase in financial funds ended up off banking balance sheets, while the figure in Europe is about 55 percent.",
            "The growth of private debt is another manifestation of the transition away from traditional financial institutions. Private debt saw its highest inflows in 2022, with growth of 29 percent, driven by direct lending.",
            "Beyond the balance sheet, transactions and payments also are shifting. For example, consumer digital payment processing conducted by payments specialists grew by more than 50 percent between 2015 and 2022 (Exhibit 6).",
            "The oscillating interest rate environment will affect the Great Transition, but exactly how remains to be seen. We may be going through a phase in which a long-term macroeconomic turning pointâincluding a higher-for-longer interest rate scenario and an end to the asset price super cycleâchanges the attractiveness of some models that were specifically geared to the old environment, while other structural trends, especially in technology, continue. Fundamentally, the question for banks is to what extent they can offer the products in high demand at a time when risk capacity is broadening and many clients and customers are searching for the highest deposit yields.",
            "Regardless of the macroeconomic developments, financial institutions will have to adapt to the changing environment of the Great Transition, especially the trends of technology, regulation, risk, and scale. Mergers and acquisitions may gain importance.",
            "As financial institutions consider how they want to change, we outline five priorities which, though not an exhaustive list, can serve as thought starters (Exhibit 7).",
            "All these priorities have significant implications for financial institutionsâ capital plans, including the more active raising and return of capital. As financial institutions reexamine their businesses and identify their relative competitive advantages in each of the balance sheet, transactions, and distribution components, they will need to ensure that they are positioned to generate adequate returns. And they will need to do so in a very different macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and at a time when AI and other technologies are potentially changing the environment and with a broader set of competitors. Scale and specialization will be determinant, as will value-creating diversification. Minimum economies of scale are also likely to shift, especially where technology and data are the drivers of scale. The years ahead will likely be more dynamic than the immediate past, with the gap between winners and losers increasing even more.  Now is the time to begin charting the path forward.",

            ", a 2011 movie about Wall Street. And itâs a good summary of wholesale bankingâs stance on AI and its subset machine learning. Corporate and investment banks (CIB) first adopted AI and machine learning decades ago, well before other industries caught on. Trading teams have used machine learning models to derive and predict trading patterns, and theyâve used natural-language processing (NLP) to read tens of thousands of pages of unstructured data in securities filings and corporate actions to figure out where a company might be headed.",
            "Today, some CIB institutions are using AI at scale and reaping enormous benefits. But much of the industry lags behind the leading CIB institutions; many banks are using bespoke, artisan-like approaches that are inherently less productive.

A few leading banks have made AI-related progress on some of these areas, including ",

            "Consider a couple of examples. CIB banks can strengthen their compliance work by using gen AI to sort through regulatorsâ reports, read them intelligently in the way that a junior compliance officer would, find the most relevant report, and then write a synopsis for a senior officer to act on. They can improve their competitiveness in client servicing by using the technology to write documents that are currently produced by hand. And they can tap tools such as Broadridgeâs BondGPT",

Exchanges and information providers, payments companies, and hedge funds regularly release code; in our experience, these heavy users could cut time to market in half for many code releases.",
            "For many banks that have long been pondering an overhaul of their technology stack, the new speed and productivity afforded by gen AI means the economics have changed.

That comes as a big relief: up to 60 percent of CIB servicing is done through email and manual documentation. In post-trade services, banks are using gen AI to read the documentation on corporate actionsâand, critically, banks are using NLU to assess the implications of corporate actions across clients and products. And in the middle office, banks are automating manual tasks. Gen AI is proving capable of writing technical documents such as financial; environmental, social, and governance (ESG); and audit reports. Itâs also being used to write loan contracts such as mortgages.",
            "A leading Asian corporate bank, for example, had a problem: its RMs were spending a lot of time painstakingly summarizing the bankâs sustainability performance and filling out questionnaires required by each of their B2B clients. To get ahead of the problem, the bank started using gen AI to extract knowledge from across the enterprise to answer the questions that RMs were typically asked. The bank turned these questions into prompts for its large-language model, which was trained on the bankâs ESG-related content. The gen AI tool synthesized material across sources (and named the sourcesâa must-have), extracted supporting quotes, and stated its confidence in its work. Analysts then took over; they found that the gen AI toolâs answers were 90 percent correct. Now, RMs are saving 90 percent of the time they used to spend on this task.",
            "Marketing and sales is a third domain where gen AI is transforming bankersâ work. The most exciting opportunity might be in relationship management, where gen AI has the potential to take all voice and text interactions with clients (and internal discussions about the client) and use them to create an âRM assistant.â A gen AIâpowered tool on the RMâs desktop can help with tasks such as investment ideas, sales, and product policies nearly instantly. This could cut the time needed to respond to clients from hours or days down to seconds. Gen AI can help junior RMs better meet client needs through training simulations and personalized coaching suggestions based on call transcripts.",
            "CIB marketers can also use the new tools to automatically summarize a bankâs knowledge and use it to create viable marketing content, such as market recaps, research reports, and pitch books. A leading investment bank, for example, has built a gen AI tool to help analysts write first drafts of pitch books. The analyst uploads all the relevant documents and then queries the chatbot to ensure it has the material it needs. Then, the analyst can instruct the tool to produce many of the slides that are typically needed and many others that reflect the specifics of the proposed investment. The tool saves analysts about 30 percent of the time they used to spend creating pitchbooks.",
            "These three domainsânew product development, customer operations, and marketing and salesârepresent the most promising areas for the technology. But other functions can also benefit.Â Consider loan origination and decisioning. Gen AI can extract textual content from customer interactions, loan and collateral documents, and public news sources to improve credit models and early-warning indicators. Or it can look at risk and compliance support, as many banks are doing, whereby gen AI can provide support to first- and second-line functions to identify relevant regulations and compliance requirements and to help locate relevant instructions. The technology is not yet at a state where banks can have sufficient confidence to hand over risk and compliance tasks fully. But significant contributions are already possible today.",
            "In short, itâs no exaggeration to say that gen AI could transform the day-to-day for wholesale bankers (exhibit).",
            "Most CIB institutions are starting with a proof of concept for a gen AI application. To move beyond that stage, banks will want to build on their current capabilities and technology for AI and machine learning to ensure that the following elements are in place:",
            ". CIB leaders should define a clear strategy of how they want to integrate gen AI into their processes. Does gen AI completely transform their core business (as it might in market- and equity-research support), or does it provide a revenue uplift or productivity opportunity? Early adopters have had good results by starting with a top-down value heat map of the bankâs revenue and cost lines across CIB divisions to locate the potential for value creation.",
            "A consideration of costs must be part of the road map. Every step of developing gen AIâembedding and storing knowledge, supporting thousands of queries daily, building and training new modelsâcan result in significant costs. Banks will need to identify the best combination of models for their intended applications, to not only guarantee accuracy and sustainable performance but also capture the value identified in the road map.",
            "Organizations will need to be mindful of and carefully plan for risks associated with scaling generative AI. Here are some of the major concerns that CIB firms will need to address:",
            "In short, gen AI models create a new set of risks that will need to be managed. As they build new gen AI models, banks will also have to redesign their model risk governance frameworks and design a new set of controls.",
            "Over the past ten years or so, a handful of corporate and investment banks have developed a genuine competitive edge through judicious use of traditional AI. Now, the race is on to do so again with an even more transformative technology.",

        "paragraphs": [
            "of customer experience (CX) in insurance? What sets the industryâs CX leaders apart from the restâand what can we learn from their examples?",
            "In search of answers, McKinsey launched a survey of more than 8,500 insurance customers of the 40 largest North American insurance carriers across the life and property and casualty (P&C) segments (see sidebar, âAbout the researchâ). The results were clear: customer experience is a strong predictor and driver of financial and organizational outcomes. CX leaders, defined as those with above-median customer experience scores, outperform their peers across the boardâfrom TSR and revenue growth to employee and agent satisfaction.",
            " McKinsey completed the North American Insurance Customer Experience Survey, polling insurance customers of the 40 largest insurance carriers, which account for roughly 80 percent of individual net premiums written. Results were collected from more than 8,500 individuals, split evenly between life insurance and property and casualty customers.",
            "In addition to measuring customer satisfaction, the survey also collected insights on nine customer journeys and more than 40 customer subjourneys, asked about preferences across more than ten channels and modes of interaction (for example, speaking with an agent over the phone and meeting an agent in person), and evaluated more than 30 underlying experience drivers (such as wait times and follow-ups). Our analysis offers a granular view of customersâ experiences with insurers across various journeys, channels, and touchpoints.",
            "For insurance carriers, CX matters now more than ever. Customers have come to expect personalized advice, omnichannel experiences, and seamless end-to-end journeys, shaped by their interactions with digital natives both within and outside the industry. Too often, their experiences with insurance fall short of those expectations, especially when it comes to sales and distribution. Meanwhile, rapidly changing consumer preferences, new competitive threats, and a challenging macroeconomic environment have raised the stakes. Insurers must find a way to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse and digital customer baseâor they risk watching their customers leave.",
            "Because CX initiatives take months or years to realize their full potential, the time to invest is now. To maximize the value of these investments, insurance carriers should embrace a holistic and agile approach that emphasizes transparency (for example, by benchmarking against peers using customer experience scores and other CX-related operational metrics), data-driven decision making (by anchoring on KPIs across various customer journeys), and a clear sense of urgency that can be sustained throughout the 12 to 24 months it can take to undergo a customer-centric transformation.",
            "Customer experience is a key differentiator and source of competitive advantage in more ways than one. Insurers often find that investing in CX also drives operational efficiencies and that these âstacked winsâ combine to improve the bottom line. By harnessing the potential of CX and overcoming its pitfalls,",
            " insurers can deliver superior experience and capture the significant value at stake.",
            "The survey revealed that CX drives material financial impact and unlocks step-change improvements in financial and organizational performance for insurers. Notably, CX leaders outperformed their peers in TSR by 20 percentage points for life insurers and 65 percentage points for P&C insurers in the five-year period from 2017 to 2022. Compared with others, CX leaders also demonstrated stronger revenue growth (by four percentage points), stronger EBIT growth (by four percentage points), lower expense ratios (by two percentage points), and higher employee satisfaction scores. Our experience shows that improving CX can also lead to higher retention, new business, and operational efficiencies for both life and P&C insurance carriers.",
            "The positive (or negative) impact of CX creates ripple effects beyond the four walls of an insurance carrier. Poor CX is often a primary barrier to purchasing insurance, and life insurance ownership already dropped to just 52 percent in 2021âthe lowest rate in a decade.",
            " CX improvements could enable insurance carriers to bridge protection gaps and advance their broader social purpose of protecting lives and livelihoods.",
            "When it comes to consistently delivering a distinctive experience, insurance companies must confront a unique set of challenges. Some are inherent to the complexity of the product and distribution model. Others are the result of chronic underinvestment in specific capabilities and digital offerings. All of them represent a meaningful opportunity for insurance carriers to pull away from the pack and transform CX into a competitive advantage.",
            "Customers typically interact with their insurance carrier once or twice a year. This is in stark contrast with other financial-services industries such as banking, in which customer interactions take place ten to 20 times more often. The low frequency of customer touchpoints in insurance means that itâs extremely important to get each one right.",
            "The low frequency of customer touchpoints in insurance means that itâs extremely important to get each one right.",
            "In 2023, âgetting it rightâ often translates to offering seamless, omnichannel customer journeys. But this hardly describes the insurance experience today. The customer journey is typically fragmented from the start: six out of ten customers switch channels prepurchase. Moreover, the transition from online to offline channels can be abrupt or nonexistent. Roughly one in six customers reports no follow-up from insurers after an initial discussion related to financial advice. And of those who do hear back, 40 percent report interacting with two or more people, which can lead to a disjointed experience. Insurers canâand mustâdo more to close these gaps and ensure that customer interactions can move seamlessly between offline and online channels.",
            "Channel preferences differ between life and P&C customer segments. For example, customers in both industries frequently interact with their insurers through agents, but life insurance customers are significantly more likely to do so. Websites are more popular among P&C customers, who report higher satisfaction and openness toward digital channels than life customers. McKinsey research suggests that life insurance customers would shift toward digital channels if they perceived them to be more secure, reliable, and easy to use. Third-party platforms have the lowest satisfaction scores among channels, however, with an average CSAT score of 5.4 compared with an average CSAT score of 5.8 across all other channels,",
            " indicating an opportunity to improve CX across the broader digital ecosystem.",
            "Today, a majority of insurance customers are open to using digital channels for routine servicing such as payments and account changesâa trend that has only accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet when customers take advantage of digital channels, they are often left wanting more. More than 30 percent of insurance customers are not satisfied with the digital channels available, and only 20 percent of customers say that digital channels are their top choice for interacting with their insurer. In the meantime, new challengers, including insurtechs and large financial players, are leading with digital and technology capabilities and are threatening to erode the market share of incumbents.",
            "One insurer developed leading digital capabilities with the goal of decreasing underwriting turnaround time for customers. As a result of this CX initiative, the insurance carrier not only experienced higher straight-through processing rates but also made improvements to the overall enrollment experience.",
            "Despite the shift toward digitalization, insurers cannot sacrifice the human touch in CXâespecially for life customers, who rank agents as the most trusted source for learning about insurance products. Our survey found that agents and advisers are still the highest-rated channel when it comes to customer satisfaction, and 20 percent of customers report that they would likely switch insurance carriers if their adviser left. Life customers who speak with their agents at least once a quarter have an average customer experience score of approximately 50âcompared with roughly 30 for those who speak with their agent annually and zero for those with even fewer touchpoints. Yet only half of insurance customers interact with their agent or adviser on an annual basis, suggesting that insurance carriersâespecially life insurersâmay be missing out on opportunities to deepen their customer relationships.",
            "A closer look at the data reveals that channel preferences vary significantly by customer journeys and by customer segments. For customer journeys such as researching and learning about insurance or making an account change, roughly half of survey respondents prefer to speak with an agent or customer service representative, while the other half prefer to use digital channels (such as websites or chat features). At the same time, for more-complex journeys such as buying a policy or resolving an issue, more than 70 percent of customers prefer in-person interaction with an agent or third-party representative. It is important to note that as insurers level up their digital capabilities and channel interactions, these preferences may change over time.",
            "Insurance carriers must solve for the preferences not of the average consumer but of a diverse range of customers. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Tired of general product pushes, customers also expect advisers to understand their needs and provide personalized advice. Yet this becomes more difficult as the insurance customer base grows more diverse. In this environment, insurers must effectively deliver solutions for multiple customer types and develop multiproduct relationships that can satisfy a diverse population.",
            "Buying insurance can seem daunting. Customers often find themselves confused and overwhelmed by the plethora of options. The survey found that on average, customers contact their insurer four times in the process of learning about and considering different insurance products. Even after a purchase, customers may not fully understand the value that insurance provides. Roughly 40 percent of insurance customers who considered canceling their policy were considering doing so because they believed the policy was not necessary or did not provide sufficient value. Complicating matters further is the highly intermediated distribution system of traditional insurers that can include agents, brokers, aggregators, and B2B2C (group channels). All of these factors can hamstring an insurance carrierâs ability to deliver a superior experience to its customers.",
            "The inherent complexity of insurance products requires a more deliberate effort from insurers to inform and educate customers. Products need to be simplified and transparent, and product information must be widely accessible and easy to understand. Insurers should also harness the expertise of their agents and advisers to provide personalized advice that can help customers navigate the process and understand the various trade-offs of their decisions.",
            "Customer, employee, and agent experiences are symbiotic. In our experience, the most effective organizations should involve employees and agents as cocreators of change. CX initiatives often call for new ways of working that alleviate the pain points of employees and agents on the front line while equipping them with the visibility and the tools to better serve their customers. Delivering better CX can also tap into a powerful source of meaning for employees,",
            " which can, in turn, lead to higher rates of employee satisfaction and retention. Indeed, our experience shows that successful customer-centric transformations in insurance typically lead to a 20 percent uplift in employee satisfaction.",
            "As part of its customer-centric transformation, one insurer trained 35 percent of its employees and virtually all of its agents on CX capabilities. In addition to doubling its customer experience scores, the insurance carrier experienced a 25 percent reduction in processing times as well as meaningful improvements in cross-sell and retention rates.",
            "Customer expectations have soared in the past few years. Noninsurers are raising the CX bar by offering personalized recommendations, omnichannel advice, and digital end-to-end journeys. As more and more companies adopt these new rules of customer engagement, why should customers expect anything less from insurers?",
            "Like their peers in other industries, insurers can follow a proven formula for executing customer-centric transformations. The approach comprises three building blocks: a clearly defined aspiration and road map, an agile transformation approach, and a thoughtful deployment of new capabilities and ways of working. In the initial aspiration-setting phase, leaders can run a rigorous diagnostic to size and validate the full potential of the transformation. This is followed by an execution phase, which involves designing the new CX organization and operating model, reimagining the highest-value customer journeys, and launching CX initiatives with cross-functional teams and agile principles. Such initiatives often target areas that both improve customer experience and deliver operational efficienciesâanother way in which CX is a winâwin proposition. In the final stage, the insurer scales these initiatives across the organization and builds the capabilities required to sustain CX excellence well into the future.",
            "CX leaders deliver more value to their customers, their employees, their agents, and their bottom lines. Despite the challenges, insurance carriers have an opportunity to invest in their people and their capabilities to drive CX improvements and capture significant value while better serving their customers.",

            ", and ",
            ", representing views from McKinseyâs Banking Practice.",
            "Besides noting the industryâs performance in 2022, we take a longer view and see the progress the industry has made since businesses first began creating systems to process their payments. From its early days to the present, the payments sector has already been through three distinct eras. Evidence suggests the industry may be on the verge of a fourth era, which we interpret as an era of âdecoupling.â This new era presents concrete opportunities for banks and other payments players.",
            "Globally, payments revenues proved remarkably resilient, overcoming a variety of regional headwinds to grow at rates well above the established long-term trend. Payments revenues grew at 11 percent in 2022âa double-digit rate for the second consecutive yearâreaching more than $2.2 trillion, an all-time high (Exhibit 1).",
            "Revenue growth was broadly distributed geographically, with three of the four regions posting their strongest increases in a decade. North America, Latin America, and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) all grew at double-digit rates.",
            "The exception to this trend is AsiaâPacific. In recent years, this region, which accounts for 47 percent of global payments revenues, has served as the primary growth vector. But in 2022, regional revenues rose just 4 percent, as a result of a 3 percent decline in payment revenues in China. Excluding China, however, the AsiaâPacific region grew at 25 percentâfaster than in 2022.",
            "The economies with the largest payments revenue pools delivered growth at or above the mean, contributing to 2022âs strong result. This list, which includes Brazil, India, Japan, and the United States, posted solid results in both interest and fee-driven revenues.",
            "A key insight into Chinaâs results is a 5 percent decline in transactional fee revenue. It fell to $255 billion as a result of smaller ticket sizes on card transactions and fee concessions implemented by payments providers to spur small and medium-size enterprise (SME) activity and counteract the COVID-19 macroeconomic shock.",
            "In many markets, about half of 2022âs revenue growth came from rising interest rates, interrupting a long-standing trend in which fees were the main source of growth. The shifting interest rate environment had the greatest impact on the EMEA region, where net interest margins jumped markedly, reversing a trend of the last decade. EMEAâs transaction-based revenue continued to grow at a steady pace (5 percent in 2022), while net interest incomeâs (NII) share of total revenues rose from 33 percent to 45 percent in a single year, bringing it closer in line with other regions.",
            "Another way to understand payments revenues is by customer segment (commercial and consumers) and the products that the industry delivers to each (Exhibit 2). The mix has been subtly but persistently tilting toward commercial across all regions for some time. Overall, commercial now accounts for 53 percent of revenues, and consumer 47 percent. This proportion varies from region to region. Commercial revenues have long predominated in AsiaâPacific and EMEA. Consumers still generate the majority in North America (63 percent) and Latin America (54 percent), where markets remain mostly card driven.",
            "Cross-border payment dynamics were particularly robust. Flows reached about $150 trillion in 2022, a 13 percent increase in a single year. This money movement generated an even greater increase in cross-border revenues, which rose 17 percent to $240 billion. Revenues from cross-border consumer paymentsâboth C2B and C2Câincreased at double-digit rates, accelerating from high single digits in 2021. Conversely, both forms of commercial payments (B2B and B2C) grew by 10 percent, somewhat slower than 2021âs postpandemic surge.",
            "The USâLatin America corridor remains the largest for C2C remittances, representing 11 percent of the total value of such flows. Central America has been an increasingly relevant destination for remittances and humanitarian aid from the United States.",
            "While B2B remains the primary driver of cross-border revenue (69 percent of the total), the consumer categories carry higher margins and are projected to grow more rapidly over the next five years. Much of the growth is expected to be in C2B, related to increased travel and e-commerce spending.",
            "Our analysis suggests that future revenue growth will likely be stimulated by instant-payments innovations and the rise in digital wallets in certain geographies. The increase in electronic payments transaction volumes has consistently outpaced payments revenue growth (17 percent versus 6 percent) over the past five years. This is indicative of the continuing evolution in payments preferences, a general migration toward lower-fee instruments, and the gradually declining margins that accompany scale.",
            "These dynamics are also evident in cash displacement. Cash usage declined by nearly four percentage points globally in 2022. Worldwide, the decline in cash usage during the pandemic shows no evidence of being reversed, led downward by the cash-reliant economies of India and Brazil, where the share of cash transactions fell by seven to ten percentage points. Brazilâs cash declines are concurrent with the rapid uptake of the countryâs PIX instant-payments network.",
            "A similar transformation is taking place on a smaller scale in Nigeria, where instant-payments capabilities are being built into point-of-sale devices to facilitate merchant enablement. Nigeriaâs share of cash transactions fell from 95 percent in 2019 to 80 percent in 2022. Over the same period, instant paymentsâ share quadrupled to 8 percent.",
            "Instant payments are playing a key role in this transition out of cash. In Brazil, almost half of the transactional revenue growth through 2027 is expected to come from instant payments. Yet in other places, revenue growth from instant payments could be meager. Instant payments in India are expected to contribute less than 10 percent of future revenue growth because no fees are currently charged for the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). Conversely, in several European countries such as Germany, instant payments are perceived as a premium option, resulting in relatively strong potential for revenue growth.",
            "By 2027, cash-heavy developing economies are likely to make further significant shifts toward instant payments, bringing these transactionsâ share to roughly half of overall payment transactionsânearly two-and-a-half to three times greater than in 2022. By contrast, our analysis indicates that near-term impact in mature markets such as the US and UK will be nominal. Instant payments remain in a nascent stage in the US, where 2022âs cash decline was more muted following 2021âs reduction associated with pandemic restrictions. July 2023âs launch of the Federal Reserveâs FedNow real-time payment rails may prove to be an inflection point, but the effect will be gradual.",
            "The story varies from country to country, but the developments in Europe are worth a second glance. Today, instant payments constitute 12 percent of the credit transfer volume in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) (Exhibit 3). Absent regulatory intervention, this share could double by 2027, and if regulators proceed with anticipated actions to encourage adoption, this share could rise to 45 percent of SEPAâs 23 billion annual transactions and a far higher share of account-to-account (A2A) payments, including transfers done through Automated Clearing House (ACH), real-time gross settlement (RTGS), and instant payments.",
            "Digital wallets, the source and destination of much of the flow in instant payments, are similarly booming. Several business models are taking shape in different parts of the world. In several African countries (Kenya, Ghana, and Tanzania, for instance), mobile-wallet infrastructure is ubiquitous and interoperable. Nigeriaâs Central Bank spurred uptake by pushing a âcashless economyâ during a note-change process in early 2023. Demand for digital payment solutions has spiked among Nigerian merchants of all sizes. One acquirer reports that 70 percent of the new merchant customers havenât previously accepted digital paymentsâa clear indicator of expanding network effects.",
            "Overall, the payments industryâs 2022 revenue and valuation growth are consistent with optimism about the future. Our analysis indicates that the five-year outlook is strong, with likely revenue growth of 6 to 8 percent. The opportunities will likely be widespread: all four regions are projected to expand at an annual average of 6 percent or higher. Fee-based revenue growth is forecast to return to slightly exceed interest-based contributions, and global electronic transaction volumes should continue to grow (15 percent in this case) at rates exceeding revenue. Although these interest rate effects may moderate in the coming years, the market remains on pace to exceed $3 trillion in payments revenue by 2027.",
            "During the last few decades, as the payments industry has grown, it has rapidly embraced new technologies, in the process opening new avenues to serve customers. Along with these changes, the composition of revenue sources has been evolving. Cash usage is declining rapidly, having lost 20 percentage points in the share of global payments over the past five years. Net interest margin is driving a greater share of growth, and players are moving into less penetrated areas of the payments value chain. Together, these changes suggest that the industry is poised to be defined by a new business model.",
            "The industry has been through three distinct eras, dominated, in turn, by paper, plastic, and account-based transactions (Exhibit 4). Since the 1990s, payments has operated in the Account Era, with plastic no longer required to access funds. The emergence of online capabilities at the end of the last century fueled the start of this era, as internet and mobile technologies empowered users to direct funds from their accounts, leveraging existing infrastructure. But in the present decade, we see signs of a fourth era starting; we call it the Decoupled Era.",
            "To anticipate what this means for banks and other payments providers, it is possible to consider the dynamics of the past progression from paper to plastic to accounts. First, older payment mechanisms donât disappear but rather decline in usage. Each successive era has also leaned harder into technology, fostering disruption and requiring established institutions to undertake extensive retooling. Payments have become more embedded into shopping journeys, making them increasingly important to users in pursuit of convenience. Finally, each era has seen more competitors enter the market, driving transaction volumes and lower costs in both consumer and commercial segments.",
            "The Decoupled Era will likely be characterized by payments becoming increasingly disconnected from accounts and other fixed repositories of value. Users will have an even greater voice as they seek convenience, affordability, and security. The Decoupled Era is shaping up to be further reliant on technologyâwith the winning technologies yet to be determined. Contenders include platform as a service (PaaS) models, enabling niche providers and promising seamless customer transitions across products and services, and generative AI, which will further personalize customer experiences, streamline payments processes, and protect against fraud.",
            "While the expectation is for the emergence of some new players in the Decoupled Era, archetypes of existing players could morph as well. Fintechs, having pivoted their business models toward sustainability, will likely either move further into traditional financial services or aggressively pursue partnerships to fulfill customer needs. Banks in turn will likely seek more independence and control across the value chain, which may take the form of partnerships or M&A.",
            "Competition for customer deposits and balances will likely intensify in the Decoupled Era in tandem with heightened pursuit of customer relationships. We believe returns will accrue to players that can seamlessly embed payments into customer lifestyles and behaviors.",
            "The business models, solutions, and firms of the Account Era remain relevant, but the Decoupled Era generates new opportunities for actors willing to explore fresh growth vectors. Banks will no longer be able to rely solely on the account ownership paradigm. They will need to build new businesses to differentiate and keep customers within their service ecosystem.",
            "Given that payments has become a technology business, API-driven solutions and other next-generation technologies factor into many opportunities to scale business impact, both in ",
            " (often capitalizing on the trend toward embedded finance) and in driving operational efficiencies.",
            "One of the biggest business-scaling opportunities is cross-border transactions, particularly those with ticket sizes less than $100,000 in consumer and SME segments. Although low-value payments represent 8 percent of cross-border payment flows, they account for roughly one-third of revenue because of extensive retail networks and higher margins.",
            "Pressure to digitize extends throughout the enterprise. With an uncertain economic environment and companies keeping less excess cash in operating accounts, leaders need better visibility into real-time account positions and access to efficient financing. Banks have a unique opportunity to extend valuable automation and digitization services to the office of the CFO, bringing their underwriting expertise and balance sheet access to the table.",
            "Several other opportunities await. ",
            " represent one of a bankâs most critical resources and among the most important revenue streams for corporate transaction banks around the globe. Corporate deposits generate 40 to 45 percent ($500 billion to $550 billion) of transactional bank revenues globally. Additionally, retail deposits continue to be 43 percent of current account balances. Investors are closely monitoring banksâ resilience in pivoting their deposit strategies to address the new market realities, given recent withdrawals and increasing market volatility in response to rising interest rates, credit restrictions, and liquidity gaps.",
            "Banks can double down on internal productivity in three ways: generative AI, technology modernization, and the ongoing battle to prevent financial crime. Banking has already made great strides with âtraditionalâ AI in marketing and customer operations. McKinsey Global Institute estimates that ",
            " could further increase productivity in banking by 2.8 to 4.7 percent, equivalent to $200 billion to $340 billion in annual revenues.",
            " can reduce operating costs by 20 to 30 percent and halve time to market for new products. McKinseyâs Operating Model Index, compiled from research across 150 leading financial institutions, finds that those scoring higher on operating-model maturity tend to grow fasterâby 20 percent on averageâand to be more profitable (69 percent higher TSR) than the others. Incumbentsâ technology gap with fintechs and native digital players continues to widen; banks must identify where paying down technical debt will deliver the most benefit, and they may want to consider partnerships as another opportunity.",
            "The face of ",
            " has changed. Todayâs financial criminals are sophisticated, leveraging low-cost tools that exploit recent technological advancements, but these new technologies, including generative AI, also offer new avenues for defending against fraud. Early examples indicate that using generative AI to automate or accelerate currently manual activities could boost productivity in fraud detection by 30 to 50 percent. Payments companies will likely need to upgrade their fraud operations from back-office functions to an actively managed competence center, but doing so should reduce losses and enhance customer experience.",
            "The outlook for the payments sector remains strong, with five-year growth projected at or above the long-term average. The vectors of growth are evolving, however, and banks must optimize the profitability of such growth. This requires a detailed evaluation of their business, making clear and difficult investment decisions in building an efficient payments operating core that delivers a share of that growth to both the top and bottom lines.",

Banks, asset managers, and other institutions are intrigued by the technological potential of âtokenizationââthe process of issuing a digital representation of a traditional asset on a (typically private) blockchain, sometimes referred to as a distributed ledger. Several leaders of large institutions have publicly voiced interest in tokenizationâs potential to transform capital markets.",

            "This article attempts to provide a careful and balanced look at some of the asserted benefits and perennial challenges of tokenization across asset classes. From this, we conclude that challenges remain, but growing institutional interest and stronger business fundamentals across certain asset classes offer potential for a different outcome this time, especially for players that follow a well-structured approach.",
            "The âtokenizationâ of an asset involves the following four steps:",
            "Tokenization refers to the process of creating a token on a blockchain that represents an asset. These tokens can be representations of traditional tangible assets (such as real estate, agricultural or mining commodities, analog artworks), financial assets (equities, bonds), or nontangible assets such as digital art and other intellectual property. Whether these assets have a parallel representation in other systems of record (âoff-chainâ in a central securities depository, say) or are native to the on-chain model, tokenization typically involves four fundamental steps (see sidebar, âThe process of tokenizationâ).",
            "Tokenization gives asset holders and market makers access to blockchain technologyâs potential benefits. Broadly speaking, these include 24/7 operations and data availability, along with so-called atomic (that is, instantaneous) settlement. In addition, tokenization offers programmabilityâthat is, the ability to embed code in the token, and the ability of the token to engage with smart contractsâenabling higher degrees of automation.",
            "More specifically, when tokenization is conducted at scale, beyond proofs of concept, its benefits will differ by asset class but could include some combination of the following (exhibit):",
            "In light of these benefits, itâs clear why many big banks and asset managers are intrigued by the technologyâs promise. However, some of these benefits remain theoretical in nature given the lack of scale of tokenized assets and use cases, and it begs the question why more progress has not been achieved over the past six years.",
            "Despite the benefits tokenization may deliver, few assets have been tokenized to date. A notable exception is cash, in the form of fully reserved\nâstablecoinsâ and tokenized bank deposits.",
            "Why hasnât digital-asset tokenization achieved widespread adoption to date? Conditions have posed challenges related to infrastructure, implementation costs, market maturity, regulation, and industry alignment.",
            "Adoption of tokenization is held back by limitations of the available infrastructure. The limitations include a continuing shortage of institutional-grade digital-assets custody and wallet solutions offering sufficient flexibility in managing account policies, such as trading limits. Also, blockchain technology, particularly the public permissionless versions of it, has been hindered by limited system uptime at high transaction throughputsâa deficiency that is unacceptable to support tokenization of certain use cases, particularly in mature capital markets. Finally, the fragmented (private) blockchain infrastructureâincluding developer tooling, token standards, and smart-contract guidelinesâcreates interoperability challenges across financial institutions. This introduces new risks (such as bridging protocols between blockchains), fragmentation of liquidity, and challenges in harmonizing data across systems to deliver necessary reporting.",
            "Many of tokenizationâs potential economic benefits come to fruition at scale, when a sizable majority of assets or use case volumes have migrated to the new digital infrastructure. However, this will likely require a cost-intensive transition to adapt middle- and back-office workflows not designed for tokenized assets. The situation implies unclear short-term benefits and a challenging business case on which to gain organizational buy-in. Further complicating the short-term business case, such transitions often involve running digital-twin operations (for example, digital and traditional settlement, data reconciliation and compliance on and off chain, digital and traditional custody and asset servicing) to reduce near-term operational and regulatory risk. Finally, many legacy clients in capital markets have yet to demonstrate interest in 24/7 infrastructure and movement of value, presenting further challenges to the go-to-market approach for tokenized products.",
            "Tokenizationâs ability to achieve faster settlement times and greater capital efficiency requires instantaneous cash settlement. However, there currently exists no cross-bank solution at scale, despite the progress that has been made on this front: tokenized deposits currently operate only within a single bank, and stablecoins lack the regulatory clarity for now to be considered bearer assets to provide for real-time ubiquitous settlement. In addition, the tokenization provider landscape has been fragmented and nascent, with no integrated and established one-stop-shop offering the requisite licenses and capabilities. A third remaining issue is the absence of at-scale distribution channels for digital assets to be accessed by the appropriate investors. Many tokenized assets are available only on homegrown platforms from tokenization providers, in contrast to the established distribution channels used by wealth and asset managers.",
            "To date, the regulatory framework for tokenization has differed substantially by region or has simply been absent. US players are particularly challenged by undefined settlement finality, lack of legally binding status of smart contracts, and unclear requirements for qualified custodians. Further unknowns remain regarding the capital treatment of digital assets. For instance, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has implied through Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 that digital assets must be reflected on the balance sheet when providing custodial servicesâa stricter standard than for traditional assets. This requirement makes it cost prohibitive for banks to hold and potentially even distribute digital assets.",
            "Capital market infrastructure players have yet\nto signal the concerted will to build out tokenization capabilities or move markets on chain, although their involvement is critical, as they are the ultimate recognized holders of books of record. Incentives to move to new infrastructure may be misaligned, given that certain functions now performed by intermediaries could become obsolete or change dramatically. Even carbon credits as an asset class have encountered challenges in gaining alignment on an established registry. At present, Gold Standard is the only registry publicly preparing to support tokenized carbon credits, despite the clear benefits of enhanced transparency.",
            "Despite the challenges, tokenization may have reached an inflection point for certain use cases and asset classes. Trends over recent months are consistent with a possible acceleration of adoption.",
            " Settling trades of tokenized assets instantaneously and 24/7 requires cash tokenization; without it, only one leg of a transaction can be completed instantly.",
            "Approximately $120 billion of tokenized cash is now in circulation in the form of fully reserved stablecoins (for example, USD Coin). Some banks have launched or will shortly launch tokenized deposit capabilities to improve the cash settlement leg of commercial trades. These nascent systems are not perfect by any means; liquidity remains fragmented, and stablecoins are not yet recognized as bearer assets. Even so, they have proven sufficient to support meaningful volumes in the digital-assets market. Stablecoin on-chain volumes have routinely exceeded $500 billion monthly.",
            "While tokenization has yet to achieve the scale needed to deliver on all its stated promises, the ecosystem is maturing, underlying challenges are becoming clearer, and the business case\nfor adoption may be improving. Initial proof points, especially in use cases that benefit from increased capital efficiency in a higher-rate environment (as opposed to the traditional argument of better liquidity for illiquid assets), highlight more use cases where the technology could gain traction and generate meaningful value for global markets over the next two to five years.",
            "Whether or not tokenization is at an inflection point, a natural question to ask is how financial-services companies should respond at this juncture. The specific time frame and ultimate adoption of tokenization are unknown, but early institutional experimentation across certain asset classes and use cases (for example, money market funds, repos, private funds, corporate bonds) has shown the potential to scale in the next two to five years. Those who would look to ensure a leading position in this ecosystem could consider the following steps.",
            "Businesses should reassess the concrete benefits and value proposition of tokenization, as well as the avenues and costs of implementation. Understanding what impact higher interest rates and volatile public markets have on specific assets or use cases is important to appropriately evaluating tokenizationâs potential benefits. Similarly, continually exploring the landscape of providers and understanding the early applications of tokenization will help to refine estimates of the technologyâs costs and benefits.",
            "Regardless of an incumbentâs position in the value chain, a few capabilities are necessary to prepare for a tokenized world. First and foremost is building a basic understanding of the technology and its associated risks, particularly relative to blockchain infrastructure and governance duties (who can approve what and when), token design (restrictions placed on the asset and enforcement of these restrictions), and system design (decisions about where books and records reside and what the implications are for the bearer nature of the asset). An understanding of these underlying principles could also inform conversations with regulators and customers who are still getting up to speed on the technology.",
            "Given the fragmented nature of the current landscape, it will be important for these emerging leaders to develop an ecosystem strategy for off-the-shelf integrations into other (legacy) systems and partners. Very few asset owners are willing to engage eight different parties to tokenize an asset; the custody, distribution, trade, and servicing of these assets should be as simple as possible. Partnerships expanding distribution and access to investors can create meaningful strategic distance for an incumbent by helping such a company reach scale.",
            "Finally, institutions that are looking to have a leading position in tokenization should provide regulators with streamlined input about emerging standards to avoid further fragmentation of liquidity, data, and composability. Some examples of key areas where standard setting can be considered include controls (that is, appropriate governance, risk and control frameworks to protect end investors), custody (what constitutes qualified custody for tokenized assets on private networks, when to use digital-twin versus digital-native records, what constitutes a good control location), token design (what type of token standards and associated compliance engine to support), and blockchain support and data standards (what data are kept on chain versus off chain, reconciliation standards).",
            "This is not the first time an industry has attempted a shift to a more modern infrastructure. These shifts are always challenging, as it means running the old and new operating models in parallel for a while, which is hard to do when costs are in focus. Regulatory uncertainty only compounds the difficulty. However, given the potential benefits tokenization can bring to financial services, recent moves by leading incumbents suggest they may be up for the challenge, although it could take some time. Meanwhile, banks, asset managers, custodians, and others can take some no-regret moves today to prepare for this possibility of a tokenized worldâthe strategic optionality may be worth it after all.",

Other countries in the region have extensive biodiversity and large industrial bases that offer considerable decarbonization potential, as well as extractive sectors (e.g., copper, lithium) that could play a key role in the global transition to net zero. ",

            "As Latin America becomes increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, physical and transition risks will probably have a greater impact on financial institutions. Latin Americaâs exposure to climate risk is rapidly intensifying.",

For example, the loss of biodiversity poses an immediate danger to agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. These sectors are critical to economic output, food security, and livelihoods, so protecting them will likely be a top priority for Latin American policy makers, international aid agencies, and multilateral development institutions within and outside the region.",
            "As public investment in conservation and climate resilience contributes to an expanding range of opportunities for complementary private investment, financial institutions can help meet the demand by building their capacity to identify, measure, and manage the impacts of climate-related risks. Institutions that position themselves to facilitate private capital flows supporting climate adaptation, resilience, and conservation may enjoy a significant competitive edge.",
            "Other regionsâ regulators became active first, but their Latin American counterparts are now beginning to address climate risk and other aspects of environmental sustainability. Central banks, securities-market regulators, and financial authorities in Asia, Europe, and North America continue to expand and refine regulatory frameworks around climate risk. In 2022, the use of climate stress-testing and scenario analysis became increasingly widespread. Prudential requirements for identifying and managing climate risks were strengthened, and in some jurisdictions, additional capital requirements were imposed on banks that fail to address climate and environmental risks. In Latin America, several central banks and supervisors have joined the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) global initiative, which enables the sharing of international best practices for systematic management of climate risk and prevention of greenwashing (i.e., promising to take, or claiming to have taken, environmentally friendly actions, without actually delivering on the promises).",

Many of these commitments focus on reducing emissions, including those generated by the institution itself and those resulting from its lending activities or investment books. About 50 percent of Latin American banking assets belong to institutions that have joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) (Exhibit 4).",

Because sustainability affects many different business and functional teams across the institution, and because implementing systemic change requires sustained managerial attention, efforts to embed sustainability concerns in routine operations could follow a holistic approach built on five key pillars (Exhibit 5).",

            "Latin American financial institutions could play a crucial role in mobilizing the investments required for the energy transition, climate-change mitigation and adaptation, and the broader preservation of environmental quality. Typically, organizations that achieve the goals for a transformation of this magnitude employ a structured approach: they estimate the business potential of sustainable finance opportunities and define the value propositions and go-to-market strategies to capture them. Such an approach includes four key components, all of which could apply to sustainability initiatives:",
            "Latin American institutions can learn from successful value propositions developed in other regions, tailor them to the local context, and build robust sustainable-finance offerings and go-to-market strategies for priority customer segments.",
            "Latin American financial institutions are exposed to geographies that face high physical risks (e.g., extreme weather events, environmental degradation) and to sectors that face high transition risks (e.g., oil and gas, mining, agriculture). Managing these risks will require developing new tools to identify and measure the risks, combined with initiatives to embed climate risk into processes for risk assessment, underwriting, portfolio monitoring, and decisions about risk appetite.",
            "Accomplishing this involves gathering new data from clients and external providers and employing new methodologies for scenario analysis and stress testing. Embedding the results of qualitative and quantitative climate risk assessments into risk appetite statements, credit underwriting and investment scorecards, pricing models, and portfolio monitoring metrics will help companies reap practical benefits such as improved decision making, lowered exposure to high-risk counterparties and geographies, and further growth in low-risk, high-return opportunities. ",
            "Implementing an effective sustainability strategy requires close coordination between the client-facing teams in the front office and those involved in product development, sustainability, risk management, regulatory compliance, and external relations. Financial institutions are likelier to achieve this level of coordination if they design fit-for-purpose routines for governance, team accountability, and program management. In parallel, they can consolidate the necessary institutional capabilities by launching new programs to build sustainability-related knowledge and expertise at levels ranging from the board and senior management to the sales teams interacting directly with clients. Targeted recruitment and consulting support can be used to acquire talent with additional specialized skills in areas such as climate science and emissions calculation. ",
            "Financial institutions also should consider acquiring and integrating new climate data from a broad range of internal, client, and vendor sources for a variety of use cases, including setting net-zero targets, assessing physical and transition risk, and identifying business advisory opportunities. Designing appropriate data governance mechanisms and a strong data architecture early in the process can help institutions avoid problems such as siloed data tables and redundant versions of the same data element in different use cases. ",
            "The fifth pillar of a successful sustainability strategy is external communications and stakeholder management. Institutions should identify which external parties to apprise of progress toward net-zero goals and other commitments, as well as opportunities to mobilize sustainable-finance flows and the evolution of climate and environmental risks. Institutions typically present this information in annual reports drafted according to international standards such as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. While TCFD is a voluntary standard for climate disclosures, securities-market regulators in Latin America and elsewhere are starting to issue specific disclosure requirements based on its approach. Similar standards for impact reporting are being developed for other topics, including biodiversity and ecosystem services. As financial institutions report on their net-zero goals and related performance, they should ensure that their reporting does not constitute greenwashing. This will require closely aligning their disclosure objectives and external communications with their strategic plans and institutional capacity-building efforts.",
            "Sectoral alliances are an increasingly prominent feature of sustainable finance. Senior executives can pursue this approach by developing a clear vision for engagement with global initiativesâfor example, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) and the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI)âand with local public- and private-sector entities. Each alliance imposes specific conditions and commitments on its signatories, and each offers unique opportunities. Determining which alliances are most consistent with achievement of the institutionâs sustainability strategy will inform the timeline for developing the required capabilities. ",
            "Finally, regulatory compliance is not merely a legal requirement but also a significant topic for sustainability strategy and implementation planning. While most Latin American countries are still in the early stages of developing sustainability requirements, policy makers in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico are elaborating their regulatory frameworks to incorporate sustainability criteria. Financial institutions across the region can stay ahead of regulatory requirements and maintain a competitive edge in the global market for sustainable finance by proactively building the capabilities currently required in other jurisdictions. ",
            "Though Latin American financial institutions have been slower to integrate sustainability into their strategic agendas than institutions elsewhere, they are beginning to accelerate their efforts. The four converging trends now reshaping the regional financial sectorâs approach to environmental protection and climate change may make 2023 a significant year for sustainable finance in Latin America. Given the complexity of this topic and the number of different teams and areas involved within each institution, the advantage may go to players that adopt a strategic and comprehensive approach.",

        "title": "How to bring the best of the bank to corporates: Ideas for coverage models",
        "description": "Attempting to serve all corporate clients through high-touch, personal interactions isn’t meeting the needs of today’s customers. The key to full coverage is a multipronged model of banking channels.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " are changing rapidly. Todayâs large companies want banking partners that not only provide essential financial services but also help them navigate the turbulent macroeconomic environment, including high inflation, changing monetary policy, ongoing supply chain challenges, and pressures to dramatically lower carbon footprints. In addition, corporate clients are looking for a step change in service across just about every interaction. When banks donât meet expectations, companies are inclined to move a greater share of their business to other banks and deepen those relationships.",
            "Our experience working with leading corporate banks around the world suggests that the solution to these challenges entails a reimagining of how banks serve their customers. The traditional coverage modelâin which relationship managers (RMs) each serve a small number of clients through high-touch, in-person interactionsâdoesnât always offer the speed of execution or level of industry expertise that banks need to stay competitive. Although todayâs clients continue to value personal interactions, they want to have more options for interacting with their banks and to be treated as a priority regardless of their size.",
            "This article, which is based on more than 100 structured interviews with CFOs and treasurers at large companies across Asia, Europe, and the United States,",
            " examines the limitations of traditional coverage models and outlines how leading banks are implementing a new approach that better serves their entire portfolio of clients at lower costs.",
            "Given the complex and dynamic needs of todayâs clients, we see traditional models restricting banks in several ways. First, these models tend to overemphasize large accounts. When RMs spend a majority of their time on face-to-face interactions, coverage is often weighted toward the 20 percent of clients that generate 80 percent of the revenues, and vast revenue potential is lost in the medium and long tail of clients receiving less attention. This often results in missed opportunities to cross-sell relevant products to smaller customers, present compelling value propositions to new clients, and make smaller clients feel valued.",
            "As a smaller client, I sometimes felt like the bank would only call me when the market was slow and they did not have larger deals to chase.",
            "A second limitation of traditional coverage models is that they often donât make full use of the technology levers now available for corporate banking, including generative AI applications. They often lack automated solutions for repetitive tasks like onboarding, know your customer (KYC), risk monitoring, and administrative requirements. RMs performing these tasks manually have less time for clients and for working with product specialists to generate ideas for clients. Giving RMs access to useful market and client data, as well as actionable and meaningful client or industry insights, can help them understand client needs and drive cross-selling opportunities.",
            "These two limitations raise the cost of coverage. In our experience, the cost to serve clients in traditional coverage models is more than 55 percent of income, on average, which puts downward pressure on a bankâs return on equity. By redesigning their coverage model, banks have been able to meet clientsâ needs more effectively and efficientlyâin some cases improving productivity by up to ten percentage pointsâwhich allows coverage teams to redirect capacity to underserved clients.",
            "Finally, despite banksâ efforts to promote greater collaboration, too many barriers still exist between frontline teams in different product areas, sectors, and regions. Without true collaboration, banks canât generate the strategic insights and innovative ideas todayâs clients want.",
            "Other industries have developed coverage models that suggest how banks can profitably capture a larger share of customer wallets and simultaneously provide better service to customers of all sizes and significance. Leading banks have already adopted these practices with an integrated multichannel strategy that employs different ways of engaging for each specific need. This new model uses three elements: highly relevant, personalized coverage; inside sales using a hybrid team of centralized RMs; and direct digital engagement (Exhibit 1).",
            "Most banks will tier this three-prong model across their client base, using different elements on an as-needed basis. In some cases, a bank can use all three elements in combination for a particular client. Consider, for example, how a bank could use the model to offer a high level of service to a large private equity investor in European and North American technology firms. The bank could deliver the following benefits:",
            "In the remainder of this section, we take a deeper look at each type of coverage channel.",
            "Face-to-face interactions and a one-to-one coverage model continue to be the ideal channel for high-value clients, but our interviews with corporate banksâ clients consistently show that companies care less about the mode of interaction and more about whether it is personalized. For example, clients in the energy and transport sectors expect their RMs to understand the implications of the energy transition for corporate investment and financing, and to provide content and recommendations relevant to their company across all possible engagement channels.",
            "My inbox is spammed daily by banking newsletters. They typically go into the bin, as we donât have capacity to process them. I really need tailored, curated, relevant-for-me bullet points.",
            "To build more sector- and company-specific know-how, leading banks are reorganizing RMs into industry-specific clusters. Not only does this deepen RMsâ understanding of particular industries and their market dynamics, it also can provide a forum for mentorship and other opportunities for RM knowledge building and professional growthâfor instance, a speaker series of external experts or master classes. In markets that are too small to be fully âsectorized,â a bank can build industry knowledge by creating clusters of related industries, such as healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and insurance in one cluster and energy, transport, and utilities in another. This allows some degree of specialization while ensuring there are enough RMs for a full desk.",
            "Creating truly meaningful and personalized client interactions, especially with members of the C-suite, requires sophisticated insights. At a minimum, banks can enable such insights by promoting knowledge sharing within industry clusters. Beyond that, leading banks are creating global insights competence centers that research macro trends and translate the findings into content tailored by sector and company. These banks have also made it easier and more convenient for RMs to access this research quickly by creating easily searchable digital knowledge platforms, often including case studies of sanitized client work (Exhibit 2).",
            "Banks are also promoting and incentivizing greater collaboration across their organizations. Some firms have put into place activity key performance indicators (KPIs) that reward RMs for including relevant subject matter experts in meetings. And a growing number of banks are bringing together coverage teams and product specialists to co-create personalized solutions with clients, such as financing that supports the development of a sustainable supply chain. Solutions created in this way can, when applicable, be adapted to meet the needs of other clients.",
            "Although personalized coverage is best suited for high-value clients, banks can also serve medium-value clients with this channel, given its potential to selectively generate event-driven or structured lending deals.",
            "Banks are beginning to explore the concept of hybrid sales teams, also known as inside sales. This approach has been successfully implemented in sectors such as telecom and high-tech, and banks serving affluent customers and small and medium-size enterprises have begun to utilize it. However, corporate banking has been slower to adopt the inside-sales model. Changing that could generate significant value.",
            "In this approach, centralized, co-located teams of RMs combine with product specialists (such as experts in global transaction banking or export financing) to serve a large portfolio of customers. Typically, for mid-corporate banking, teams of five or six RMs cover between 150 and 200 clients per relationship manager. Instead of rewarding the teams for their total revenues, which encourages attention to large clients, the bank incentivizes hybrid RM teams to serve a wide array of clients. This could mean incentives based on the level of interactions per client or an increase in revenues from the previously underpenetrated segments. These RMs receive consistent direction on specific client interactions and generally do not engage in one-to-one relationships with clients (although models may vary). Instead, clients get team coverage, product expertise on demand, service for a wide array of needs, and intelligence based on advanced analytics.",
            "This channel is an ideal fit for the medium-value segment of customersâcompanies not big enough for the expense of personal interactions. In addition, for large clients, hybrid teams can be an efficient way of supporting a businessâs cash flow, liquidity, and other treasury operations while maintaining a high service level.",
            "We have seen these hybrid models target the traditional long tail of customer portfolios with high efficiency. They generate a much higher coverage ratio, which results in lower costs and as much as a four times greater interaction frequency per RM than we see with traditional models.",
            "Although digital channels have been used most widely in service of small-business customers, midsize and large companies now expect the convenience, always-on access, and speed of digital interactions. To deliver on this, many corporate banks have integrated all client activity and interactions into a single, easy-to-use online portal. Most clients find this tool highly useful; some say they would like to increase their usage of it.",
            "I would prefer my bank to use digital dashboards more often with us. â¦ They still organize meetings in person or over video conference and do not sufficiently focus on data. A well-developed digital dashboard would be of great value for us.",
            "Room still exists for corporate banks to enhance their customer experience with digital innovation. For example, although all banks have mobile apps and web pages designed for business clients, these are often one-size-fits-all platforms that do not adequately address the needs of large corporates or offer the functionality that company decision makers want. Leading banks have designed next-generation business apps that give executives quick, easy access to high-level information of interest to them, such as balances and cash flow forecasts. These platforms also allow decision makers to approve major transactions with a single click and can be further enhanced with insights and interfaces relevant to the company or industry.",
            "Furthermore, the data generated by digital channels and interactions is underutilized as a resource to help RMs serve customers. Most RMs, for instance, donât know if a key decision maker at a client has browsed a particular page within their app or website. Nor do they receive consistent information on clientsâ previous transactions or interactions with the bank, even though this knowledge can be important for maintaining client relationships. Advanced analytics engines can provide RMs with a variety of tailored insights, such as new client opportunities and next lead suggestions; calculations of each clientâs revenue potential; detailed pricing guidance; and identification of clients at risk of churn. Giving these insights to the RMs at the right time in the right form can lead to additional client interactions and deeper conversations.",
            "Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions can ",
            " an RMâs ability to serve clients better. AI does this by speeding up the time it takes to access information and by capturing insights that might otherwise be overlooked. One large multinational bank is using AI to allow RMs to search for exactly the right research while theyâre on the phone with a client. Another bank built a generative AI solution that quickly provides synthesized answers to questions posed by RMs, and it trains RMs to ask questions in a way that will obtain the most accurate answers.",
            "We have seen digital innovations boost corporate banking revenues from nonlending products by more than 10 percent at little to no operating cost. When C-level executives can access a platform through any device and see screens customized to their needs, their companies are apt to bring more of their business to one bank. Similarly, when an interface links a suite of productsâsuch as overdrafts, current accounts, trade finance, and foreign exchange (FX)âprice sensitivity tends to fall because some clients are willing to pay for the efficiency of starting a new transaction with a single click or tap. One major bank embedded a recommendation for FX products and delivered it to clients just after they received a foreign trade letter of credit. With the automated recommendation, the bank experienced a 20 percent uptick in FX fees.",
            "Adjusting a bankâs strategy for serving existing and potential clients can lower its cost to serve, but implementation can be a significant challenge. Driving these changes requires visionary leadership and bold action from top management, as well as clear and consistent communication with the front line. This is not a one-off decision but a continuous process that should be assessed according to periodic milestones and be linked to key commercial processes, from account planning to client engagement.",
            "Banks that are winning this crucial challenge have undertaken several actions:",
            "The journey to implement a different approach to serving corporate banking customers isnât trivial. Todayâs coverage models need depth and flexibility to meet client expectations and reflect a bankâs strategies. This will require the abandonment of long-standing practices like the reliance on face-to-face interactions and overemphasis on current high-value clients. But the opportunity for impact also is nontrivial. Banks that use a multichannel approach to cover all clients in a much more tailored way can simultaneously boost client engagement, lower costs, and drive growth.",

            "Besides noting the industryâs performance in 2022, we take a longer view and see the progress the industry has made since businesses first began creating systems to process their payments. From its early days to the present, the payments sector has already been through three distinct eras. Evidence suggests the industry may be on the verge of a fourth era, which we interpret as an era of âdecoupling.â This new era presents concrete opportunities for banks and other payments players.",
            "Globally, payments revenues proved remarkably resilient, overcoming a variety of regional headwinds to grow at rates well above the established long-term trend. Payments revenues grew at 11 percent in 2022âa double-digit rate for the second consecutive yearâreaching more than $2.2 trillion, an all-time high (Exhibit 1).",
            "Revenue growth was broadly distributed geographically, with three of the four regions posting their strongest increases in a decade. North America, Latin America, and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) all grew at double-digit rates.",
            "The exception to this trend is AsiaâPacific. In recent years, this region, which accounts for 47 percent of global payments revenues, has served as the primary growth vector. But in 2022, regional revenues rose just 4 percent, as a result of a 3 percent decline in payment revenues in China. Excluding China, however, the AsiaâPacific region grew at 25 percentâfaster than in 2022.",
            "The economies with the largest payments revenue pools delivered growth at or above the mean, contributing to 2022âs strong result. This list, which includes Brazil, India, Japan, and the United States, posted solid results in both interest and fee-driven revenues.",
            "A key insight into Chinaâs results is a 5 percent decline in transactional fee revenue. It fell to $255 billion as a result of smaller ticket sizes on card transactions and fee concessions implemented by payments providers to spur small and medium-size enterprise (SME) activity and counteract the COVID-19 macroeconomic shock.",
            "In many markets, about half of 2022âs revenue growth came from rising interest rates, interrupting a long-standing trend in which fees were the main source of growth. The shifting interest rate environment had the greatest impact on the EMEA region, where net interest margins jumped markedly, reversing a trend of the last decade. EMEAâs transaction-based revenue continued to grow at a steady pace (5 percent in 2022), while net interest incomeâs (NII) share of total revenues rose from 33 percent to 45 percent in a single year, bringing it closer in line with other regions.",
            "Another way to understand payments revenues is by customer segment (commercial and consumers) and the products that the industry delivers to each (Exhibit 2). The mix has been subtly but persistently tilting toward commercial across all regions for some time. Overall, commercial now accounts for 53 percent of revenues, and consumer 47 percent. This proportion varies from region to region. Commercial revenues have long predominated in AsiaâPacific and EMEA. Consumers still generate the majority in North America (63 percent) and Latin America (54 percent), where markets remain mostly card driven.",
            "Cross-border payment dynamics were particularly robust. Flows reached about $150 trillion in 2022, a 13 percent increase in a single year. This money movement generated an even greater increase in cross-border revenues, which rose 17 percent to $240 billion. Revenues from cross-border consumer paymentsâboth C2B and C2Câincreased at double-digit rates, accelerating from high single digits in 2021. Conversely, both forms of commercial payments (B2B and B2C) grew by 10 percent, somewhat slower than 2021âs postpandemic surge.",
            "The USâLatin America corridor remains the largest for C2C remittances, representing 11 percent of the total value of such flows. Central America has been an increasingly relevant destination for remittances and humanitarian aid from the United States.",
            "While B2B remains the primary driver of cross-border revenue (69 percent of the total), the consumer categories carry higher margins and are projected to grow more rapidly over the next five years. Much of the growth is expected to be in C2B, related to increased travel and e-commerce spending.",
            "Our analysis suggests that future revenue growth will likely be stimulated by instant-payments innovations and the rise in digital wallets in certain geographies. The increase in electronic payments transaction volumes has consistently outpaced payments revenue growth (17 percent versus 6 percent) over the past five years. This is indicative of the continuing evolution in payments preferences, a general migration toward lower-fee instruments, and the gradually declining margins that accompany scale.",
            "These dynamics are also evident in cash displacement. Cash usage declined by nearly four percentage points globally in 2022. Worldwide, the decline in cash usage during the pandemic shows no evidence of being reversed, led downward by the cash-reliant economies of India and Brazil, where the share of cash transactions fell by seven to ten percentage points. Brazilâs cash declines are concurrent with the rapid uptake of the countryâs PIX instant-payments network.",
            "A similar transformation is taking place on a smaller scale in Nigeria, where instant-payments capabilities are being built into point-of-sale devices to facilitate merchant enablement. Nigeriaâs share of cash transactions fell from 95 percent in 2019 to 80 percent in 2022. Over the same period, instant paymentsâ share quadrupled to 8 percent.",
            "Instant payments are playing a key role in this transition out of cash. In Brazil, almost half of the transactional revenue growth through 2027 is expected to come from instant payments. Yet in other places, revenue growth from instant payments could be meager. Instant payments in India are expected to contribute less than 10 percent of future revenue growth because no fees are currently charged for the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). Conversely, in several European countries such as Germany, instant payments are perceived as a premium option, resulting in relatively strong potential for revenue growth.",
            "By 2027, cash-heavy developing economies are likely to make further significant shifts toward instant payments, bringing these transactionsâ share to roughly half of overall payment transactionsânearly two-and-a-half to three times greater than in 2022. By contrast, our analysis indicates that near-term impact in mature markets such as the US and UK will be nominal. Instant payments remain in a nascent stage in the US, where 2022âs cash decline was more muted following 2021âs reduction associated with pandemic restrictions. July 2023âs launch of the Federal Reserveâs FedNow real-time payment rails may prove to be an inflection point, but the effect will be gradual.",
            "The story varies from country to country, but the developments in Europe are worth a second glance. Today, instant payments constitute 12 percent of the credit transfer volume in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) (Exhibit 3). Absent regulatory intervention, this share could double by 2027, and if regulators proceed with anticipated actions to encourage adoption, this share could rise to 45 percent of SEPAâs 23 billion annual transactions and a far higher share of account-to-account (A2A) payments, including transfers done through Automated Clearing House (ACH), real-time gross settlement (RTGS), and instant payments.",
            "Digital wallets, the source and destination of much of the flow in instant payments, are similarly booming. Several business models are taking shape in different parts of the world. In several African countries (Kenya, Ghana, and Tanzania, for instance), mobile-wallet infrastructure is ubiquitous and interoperable. Nigeriaâs Central Bank spurred uptake by pushing a âcashless economyâ during a note-change process in early 2023. Demand for digital payment solutions has spiked among Nigerian merchants of all sizes. One acquirer reports that 70 percent of the new merchant customers havenât previously accepted digital paymentsâa clear indicator of expanding network effects.",
            "Overall, the payments industryâs 2022 revenue and valuation growth are consistent with optimism about the future. Our analysis indicates that the five-year outlook is strong, with likely revenue growth of 6 to 8 percent. The opportunities will likely be widespread: all four regions are projected to expand at an annual average of 6 percent or higher. Fee-based revenue growth is forecast to return to slightly exceed interest-based contributions, and global electronic transaction volumes should continue to grow (15 percent in this case) at rates exceeding revenue. Although these interest rate effects may moderate in the coming years, the market remains on pace to exceed $3 trillion in payments revenue by 2027.",
            "During the last few decades, as the payments industry has grown, it has rapidly embraced new technologies, in the process opening new avenues to serve customers. Along with these changes, the composition of revenue sources has been evolving. Cash usage is declining rapidly, having lost 20 percentage points in the share of global payments over the past five years. Net interest margin is driving a greater share of growth, and players are moving into less penetrated areas of the payments value chain. Together, these changes suggest that the industry is poised to be defined by a new business model.",
            "The industry has been through three distinct eras, dominated, in turn, by paper, plastic, and account-based transactions (Exhibit 4). Since the 1990s, payments has operated in the Account Era, with plastic no longer required to access funds. The emergence of online capabilities at the end of the last century fueled the start of this era, as internet and mobile technologies empowered users to direct funds from their accounts, leveraging existing infrastructure. But in the present decade, we see signs of a fourth era starting; we call it the Decoupled Era.",
            "To anticipate what this means for banks and other payments providers, it is possible to consider the dynamics of the past progression from paper to plastic to accounts. First, older payment mechanisms donât disappear but rather decline in usage. Each successive era has also leaned harder into technology, fostering disruption and requiring established institutions to undertake extensive retooling. Payments have become more embedded into shopping journeys, making them increasingly important to users in pursuit of convenience. Finally, each era has seen more competitors enter the market, driving transaction volumes and lower costs in both consumer and commercial segments.",
            "The Decoupled Era will likely be characterized by payments becoming increasingly disconnected from accounts and other fixed repositories of value. Users will have an even greater voice as they seek convenience, affordability, and security. The Decoupled Era is shaping up to be further reliant on technologyâwith the winning technologies yet to be determined. Contenders include platform as a service (PaaS) models, enabling niche providers and promising seamless customer transitions across products and services, and generative AI, which will further personalize customer experiences, streamline payments processes, and protect against fraud.",
            "While the expectation is for the emergence of some new players in the Decoupled Era, archetypes of existing players could morph as well. Fintechs, having pivoted their business models toward sustainability, will likely either move further into traditional financial services or aggressively pursue partnerships to fulfill customer needs. Banks in turn will likely seek more independence and control across the value chain, which may take the form of partnerships or M&A.",
            "Competition for customer deposits and balances will likely intensify in the Decoupled Era in tandem with heightened pursuit of customer relationships. We believe returns will accrue to players that can seamlessly embed payments into customer lifestyles and behaviors.",
            "The business models, solutions, and firms of the Account Era remain relevant, but the Decoupled Era generates new opportunities for actors willing to explore fresh growth vectors. Banks will no longer be able to rely solely on the account ownership paradigm. They will need to build new businesses to differentiate and keep customers within their service ecosystem.",
            "Given that payments has become a technology business, API-driven solutions and other next-generation technologies factor into many opportunities to scale business impact, both in ",
            " (often capitalizing on the trend toward embedded finance) and in driving operational efficiencies.",
            "One of the biggest business-scaling opportunities is cross-border transactions, particularly those with ticket sizes less than $100,000 in consumer and SME segments. Although low-value payments represent 8 percent of cross-border payment flows, they account for roughly one-third of revenue because of extensive retail networks and higher margins.",
            "Pressure to digitize extends throughout the enterprise. With an uncertain economic environment and companies keeping less excess cash in operating accounts, leaders need better visibility into real-time account positions and access to efficient financing. Banks have a unique opportunity to extend valuable automation and digitization services to the office of the CFO, bringing their underwriting expertise and balance sheet access to the table.",
            "Several other opportunities await. ",
            " represent one of a bankâs most critical resources and among the most important revenue streams for corporate transaction banks around the globe. Corporate deposits generate 40 to 45 percent ($500 billion to $550 billion) of transactional bank revenues globally. Additionally, retail deposits continue to be 43 percent of current account balances. Investors are closely monitoring banksâ resilience in pivoting their deposit strategies to address the new market realities, given recent withdrawals and increasing market volatility in response to rising interest rates, credit restrictions, and liquidity gaps.",
            "Banks can double down on internal productivity in three ways: generative AI, technology modernization, and the ongoing battle to prevent financial crime. Banking has already made great strides with âtraditionalâ AI in marketing and customer operations. McKinsey Global Institute estimates that ",
            " could further increase productivity in banking by 2.8 to 4.7 percent, equivalent to $200 billion to $340 billion in annual revenues.",
            " can reduce operating costs by 20 to 30 percent and halve time to market for new products. McKinseyâs Operating Model Index, compiled from research across 150 leading financial institutions, finds that those scoring higher on operating-model maturity tend to grow fasterâby 20 percent on averageâand to be more profitable (69 percent higher TSR) than the others. Incumbentsâ technology gap with fintechs and native digital players continues to widen; banks must identify where paying down technical debt will deliver the most benefit, and they may want to consider partnerships as another opportunity.",
            "The face of ",
            " has changed. Todayâs financial criminals are sophisticated, leveraging low-cost tools that exploit recent technological advancements, but these new technologies, including generative AI, also offer new avenues for defending against fraud. Early examples indicate that using generative AI to automate or accelerate currently manual activities could boost productivity in fraud detection by 30 to 50 percent. Payments companies will likely need to upgrade their fraud operations from back-office functions to an actively managed competence center, but doing so should reduce losses and enhance customer experience.",
            "The outlook for the payments sector remains strong, with five-year growth projected at or above the long-term average. The vectors of growth are evolving, however, and banks must optimize the profitability of such growth. This requires a detailed evaluation of their business, making clear and difficult investment decisions in building an efficient payments operating core that delivers a share of that growth to both the top and bottom lines.",

        "paragraphs": [
            " are poised to transform the very nature of insurance. In auto insurance, risk will shift from drivers to the artificial intelligence (AI) and software behind self-driving cars. Satellites, drones, and real-time data sets will give insurers unprecedented visibility into the risk around facilities, leading to greater accuracy. Claims processing after natural catastrophes will be automated, infinitely scalable, and lightning fast. The life insurance industry will bring to market âwrappedâ products that seamlessly adjust coverage based on the evolving needs of their customers.",
            "These scenarios arenât science fiction. The technologies behind them already exist, and innovative offerings could become mainstream in the next decade. Our analysis explored the impact of ten rapidly accelerating trends most relevant to competitive advantage.",
            " Of these ten, five are poised to reshape the insurance landscape: applied AI, distributed infrastructure, future of connectivity, next-level automation, and trust architecture. The prevalence of these technologies also means insurers could face heightened competition from a new wave of digital attackers, as evidenced by the large number of greenfield insurers founded in the past three to five years.",
            "To survive, incumbents will have to adapt their operating models, products, and core processes to a new reality. All executives must understand the impact of these technologies and ensure their organizations are positioned to unlock their potential. Leaders will need to let go of entrenched perceptions and business models and embrace new ways to manufacture and distribute what will in many cases be fundamentally different products.",
            "The past few years have seen the emergence of core technology trends that are affecting nearly every industry. A multitude of technology advancements and shifts are reshaping products and services.",
            "McKinsey examined a range of factors to identify the ten technology trends that matter most to top executives across industries (Exhibit 1). For every trend, we calculated a momentum score based on the growth rate of the technologies underlying the trends, which we derived from an in-depth analysis of six proxy metrics: patent filings, publications, news mentions, online search trends, total private investment, and the number of companies making investments.",
            "In assessing how these trends are affecting the insurance industryâacross lines and core processesâwe pinpointed five that are likely to have an outsize impact over the next few years (Exhibit 2).",
            "While many carriers are experimenting with AI, few have truly scaled their capabilities across the enterprise. As AI becomes more prevalent and algorithm creation becomes commoditized, carriers will be able to more fundamentally reengineer core processes to be more predictive in nature. AI will disrupt distribution, underwriting, claims, and service as core processes become AI-enabled, creating a âhuman in the loopâ model that increases productivity and allows for higher-quality touchpoints with customers. Carriers have yet to fully realize the potential of their data assetsâfor example, claims histories and distribution interactions. In addition to reengineering core processes, leading carriers and ecosystem players will use the advent of AI to create products and services based on data and analytics.",
            "Insurers around the world have significant technology debt, with many core processes weighed down by extensive on-premise legacy technologies. As cloud matures, a rapid shift to the cloud for all core systems will help insurers to be more nimble in launching new products and creating better customer service. Cloud will also be critical for enabling the type of compute power that is needed to fully understand and make use of the incredibly large data sets (such as tens of millions of claims data points). As ecosystems continue to develop globally, cloud-native insurers will be best positioned to act as ecosystem orchestratorsâacting as a connecting hub among customers, distributors, insurtech, healthcare providers, carriers, and reinsurers, among others.",
            "In many markets, insurers have begun using telematics to evolve the core auto product. The wider adoption of IoT could usher in a similar reshaping of product in life, health, property, and commercial lines. Increasing the frequency and specificity of data being shared through IoT devices helps customers provide a more accurate view of their needs and insurers better understand risk, both at time of purchase and an ongoing basis. The increased prevalence of 5G allows this data to be shared at lower latencies and helps insurers provide real-time services to clients.",
            "Insurers have for many years invested in robotic process automation to help automate processes, especially in back-office operations, but emerging technologies will enable carriers to fundamentally rethink product and service. For example, industrial IoT can enable real-time monitoring of equipment to allow for predictive maintenance before claims happen. Similarly, digital twins and 3D and 4D printing have the potential to transform the claims experience for all physical damage areas.",
            "Across lines, insurers handle sensitive customer information, and the ongoing evolution of products and services will require customers to share even more of this information with carriers. New technologies will allow carriers to more effectively manage risk and make use of complex customer dataâa critical step in evolving to a âpredict and preventâ model of insurance where data is shared more frequently between parties with insurers playing a more active role in claims prevention. As blockchain becomes more widely adopted, it will help carriers more effectively manage customer data in a safe and consistent manner and simplify current issues such as identity management and verification. Zero-trust security and similar approaches will help carriers create resilient networks that protect against cyber intrusions.",
            "These technology trends have the potential to materially change some of the underlying inputs of insurance products and core functions. In underwriting, for example, automated warehouses (enabled via applied AI and distributed infrastructure) may fundamentally alter the nature and focus of workersâ compensation coverage by removing the majority of human workers from most warehouse operations. The higher-order impact of these trends on insurance will likely be experienced when technological forces interact and build upon one another. As an example of this multiplicative effect, we see distributed infrastructure (such as wearables), trust architecture (enabling privacy-protected sharing of real-time health data), and applied AI (enabling real-time feedback on the impact of physical activity on personal wellness) combining to transform how insurers use data to develop predictive insights and inform a variety of interactions with policyholders. Similar innovations could take place across the insurance value chain.",
            "According to Amaraâs Law, we often overestimate the short-term impact of new technology and underestimate its long-term effect. With respect to the tech trends affecting insurance, it is unclear where the industry is in the impact continuum. Given the pace at which these trends have emerged and become disruptive (consider the rapid, in some cases exponential, increase in AI capabilities such as deep learning in the past three to five years), we may have passed the inflection point and begun to underestimate their long-term impact. These specific trends have significant momentum (as measured by the tech trends index), and innovative insurance incumbents and new entrants have started using them to offer new products and services. However, many insurers are still modernizing their technology stacks and are at an early stage of the digitalization journey, leaving them susceptible to being overtaken by more nimble players. All of these factors should be a wake-up call for insurance executives to develop an understanding of where and how these trends may affect their core products and the competitive landscape.",
            "Several scenarios could play out, depending on technology adoption, government legislation, consumer preferences, and tech-enabled product innovation.",
            "While these trends could affect property and casualty (P&C) in a range of ways, two scenarios illustrate the extent to which they could transform the landscape.",
            "applied AI, distributed data collection, future of connectivity, and next-level automation",
            "The combination of applied AI, distributed data collection, future of connectivity, and next-level automation will allow insurers to underwrite a much wider range of risks more or less automatically using real-world, real-time data from a variety of sources. Insurers can increasingly use drones, satellite-generated radar imagery, computer vision, applied AI, and smarter edge devices to collect a variety of data on facilities and assets. In just a few days, a carrier could compile a data set of radar-based and drone-generated images and image attributes of an oil rig to inform underwriting in a fraction of the time currently required. Trust architectures embedded via IoT and high-speed mobile networks allow a wide range of participants in the insurance value chain to share data in a secure and public manner.",

            " next-level automation, applied AI, trust architecture, and distributed infrastructure",
            "As the degree of automation increases in traditionally labor-intensive industries, the nature of insured risk will change. Consider a fully automated dark warehouse run by robotic pickers using applied AI and next-level automation. Risks from cyberthreats and malfunctioning AI become more acute compared with accidents caused by human error. The nature of risk will change, while some new risks may emerge and require new types of coverage and underwriting.",
            "Managing risks from autonomous and semiautonomous vehicles will force carriers to reassess how auto insurance products function. The role of insurers may shift from claims to prevention, whereby they are best placed to identify and reduce risk by partnering with clients and using technology. In many cases, insurers will need to form ecosystems and integrate a multitude of data sources.",
            " Industry revenue and profit pools could shift significantly.",
            "Through technology, insurance underwriting becomes continual rather than at a point in time, with innovative products emerging to reflect shifting customer behaviors. Models such as ecosystem-enabled data sharing will give insurers greater access to granular information to support more specific pricing and risk tiering. The combination of tech trends will enable insurers to cover individuals in more dynamic and responsive ways.",
            "future of connectivity, distributed infrastructure, applied AI, bio revolution, and trust architecture",
            " The ability to engage individuals continually will lead to products that dynamically adjust premiums, benefits, or both on a regular basis. Mortality and morbidity insurance will be a more fluid product, essentially enabling individuals to pay as they live. For example, many individuals today need to buy life insurance, critical-illness protection, disability coverage, and long-term-care coverage to fully protect their families from the financial disruption of high-cost medical events. In the future, the lines between these product categories will blur substantially, as carriers are able to offer âumbrellaâ coverage across risk categories tailored to each individual. In addition, with the bio revolution and the advent of precision medicine, carriers will be expected to have a significantly more nuanced perspective on a customerâs risk. The ability to âunbundleâ traditional protection products to create custom packages will be guided by broader regulation and actuarial standards, which will need to adapt.",

These shifts are already happening, meaning insurers should act now to develop a more ambitious vision for how technology can elevate their organizations. To embrace the potential of tech trends, winning insurers will build their tech talent, put tech trends and their business implications on the leadership agenda, and be willing to disrupt their own products and services.",

In financial services, the emphasis is shifting to the reemergence of a âblockchain, not cryptoâ narrative. Banks, asset managers, and other institutions are intrigued by the technological potential of âtokenizationââthe process of issuing a digital representation of a traditional asset on a (typically private) blockchain, sometimes referred to as a distributed ledger. Several leaders of large institutions have publicly voiced interest in tokenizationâs potential to transform capital markets.",
            " Analysts have forecast that $4 trillion to $5 trillion of tokenized digital securities could be issued by 2030.",
            " While these numbers are, of course, only projections, in-production examples at scale are emerging.

            "This article attempts to provide a careful and balanced look at some of the asserted benefits and perennial challenges of tokenization across asset classes. From this, we conclude that challenges remain, but growing institutional interest and stronger business fundamentals across certain asset classes offer potential for a different outcome this time, especially for players that follow a well-structured approach.",
            "The âtokenizationâ of an asset involves the following four steps:",
            "Tokenization refers to the process of creating a token on a blockchain that represents an asset. These tokens can be representations of traditional tangible assets (such as real estate, agricultural or mining commodities, analog artworks), financial assets (equities, bonds), or nontangible assets such as digital art and other intellectual property. Whether these assets have a parallel representation in other systems of record (âoff-chainâ in a central securities depository, say) or are native to the on-chain model, tokenization typically involves four fundamental steps (see sidebar, âThe process of tokenizationâ).",
            "Tokenization gives asset holders and market makers access to blockchain technologyâs potential benefits. Broadly speaking, these include 24/7 operations and data availability, along with so-called atomic (that is, instantaneous) settlement. In addition, tokenization offers programmabilityâthat is, the ability to embed code in the token, and the ability of the token to engage with smart contractsâenabling higher degrees of automation.",
            "More specifically, when tokenization is conducted at scale, beyond proofs of concept, its benefits will differ by asset class but could include some combination of the following (exhibit):",
            "In light of these benefits, itâs clear why many big banks and asset managers are intrigued by the technologyâs promise. However, some of these benefits remain theoretical in nature given the lack of scale of tokenized assets and use cases, and it begs the question why more progress has not been achieved over the past six years.",
            "Despite the benefits tokenization may deliver, few assets have been tokenized to date. A notable exception is cash, in the form of fully reserved\nâstablecoinsâ and tokenized bank deposits.",
            "Why hasnât digital-asset tokenization achieved widespread adoption to date? Conditions have posed challenges related to infrastructure, implementation costs, market maturity, regulation, and industry alignment.",
            "Adoption of tokenization is held back by limitations of the available infrastructure. The limitations include a continuing shortage of institutional-grade digital-assets custody and wallet solutions offering sufficient flexibility in managing account policies, such as trading limits. Also, blockchain technology, particularly the public permissionless versions of it, has been hindered by limited system uptime at high transaction throughputsâa deficiency that is unacceptable to support tokenization of certain use cases, particularly in mature capital markets. Finally, the fragmented (private) blockchain infrastructureâincluding developer tooling, token standards, and smart-contract guidelinesâcreates interoperability challenges across financial institutions. This introduces new risks (such as bridging protocols between blockchains), fragmentation of liquidity, and challenges in harmonizing data across systems to deliver necessary reporting.",
            "Many of tokenizationâs potential economic benefits come to fruition at scale, when a sizable majority of assets or use case volumes have migrated to the new digital infrastructure. However, this will likely require a cost-intensive transition to adapt middle- and back-office workflows not designed for tokenized assets. The situation implies unclear short-term benefits and a challenging business case on which to gain organizational buy-in. Further complicating the short-term business case, such transitions often involve running digital-twin operations (for example, digital and traditional settlement, data reconciliation and compliance on and off chain, digital and traditional custody and asset servicing) to reduce near-term operational and regulatory risk. Finally, many legacy clients in capital markets have yet to demonstrate interest in 24/7 infrastructure and movement of value, presenting further challenges to the go-to-market approach for tokenized products.",
            "Tokenizationâs ability to achieve faster settlement times and greater capital efficiency requires instantaneous cash settlement. However, there currently exists no cross-bank solution at scale, despite the progress that has been made on this front: tokenized deposits currently operate only within a single bank, and stablecoins lack the regulatory clarity for now to be considered bearer assets to provide for real-time ubiquitous settlement. In addition, the tokenization provider landscape has been fragmented and nascent, with no integrated and established one-stop-shop offering the requisite licenses and capabilities. A third remaining issue is the absence of at-scale distribution channels for digital assets to be accessed by the appropriate investors. Many tokenized assets are available only on homegrown platforms from tokenization providers, in contrast to the established distribution channels used by wealth and asset managers.",
            "To date, the regulatory framework for tokenization has differed substantially by region or has simply been absent. US players are particularly challenged by undefined settlement finality, lack of legally binding status of smart contracts, and unclear requirements for qualified custodians. Further unknowns remain regarding the capital treatment of digital assets. For instance, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has implied through Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 that digital assets must be reflected on the balance sheet when providing custodial servicesâa stricter standard than for traditional assets. This requirement makes it cost prohibitive for banks to hold and potentially even distribute digital assets.",
            "Capital market infrastructure players have yet\nto signal the concerted will to build out tokenization capabilities or move markets on chain, although their involvement is critical, as they are the ultimate recognized holders of books of record. Incentives to move to new infrastructure may be misaligned, given that certain functions now performed by intermediaries could become obsolete or change dramatically. Even carbon credits as an asset class have encountered challenges in gaining alignment on an established registry. At present, Gold Standard is the only registry publicly preparing to support tokenized carbon credits, despite the clear benefits of enhanced transparency.",
            "Despite the challenges, tokenization may have reached an inflection point for certain use cases and asset classes. Trends over recent months are consistent with a possible acceleration of adoption.",
            " Settling trades of tokenized assets instantaneously and 24/7 requires cash tokenization; without it, only one leg of a transaction can be completed instantly.",
            "Approximately $120 billion of tokenized cash is now in circulation in the form of fully reserved stablecoins (for example, USD Coin). Some banks have launched or will shortly launch tokenized deposit capabilities to improve the cash settlement leg of commercial trades. These nascent systems are not perfect by any means; liquidity remains fragmented, and stablecoins are not yet recognized as bearer assets. Even so, they have proven sufficient to support meaningful volumes in the digital-assets market. Stablecoin on-chain volumes have routinely exceeded $500 billion monthly.",
            "While tokenization has yet to achieve the scale needed to deliver on all its stated promises, the ecosystem is maturing, underlying challenges are becoming clearer, and the business case\nfor adoption may be improving. Initial proof points, especially in use cases that benefit from increased capital efficiency in a higher-rate environment (as opposed to the traditional argument of better liquidity for illiquid assets), highlight more use cases where the technology could gain traction and generate meaningful value for global markets over the next two to five years.",
            "Whether or not tokenization is at an inflection point, a natural question to ask is how financial-services companies should respond at this juncture. The specific time frame and ultimate adoption of tokenization are unknown, but early institutional experimentation across certain asset classes and use cases (for example, money market funds, repos, private funds, corporate bonds) has shown the potential to scale in the next two to five years. Those who would look to ensure a leading position in this ecosystem could consider the following steps.",
            "Businesses should reassess the concrete benefits and value proposition of tokenization, as well as the avenues and costs of implementation. Understanding what impact higher interest rates and volatile public markets have on specific assets or use cases is important to appropriately evaluating tokenizationâs potential benefits. Similarly, continually exploring the landscape of providers and understanding the early applications of tokenization will help to refine estimates of the technologyâs costs and benefits.",
            "Regardless of an incumbentâs position in the value chain, a few capabilities are necessary to prepare for a tokenized world. First and foremost is building a basic understanding of the technology and its associated risks, particularly relative to blockchain infrastructure and governance duties (who can approve what and when), token design (restrictions placed on the asset and enforcement of these restrictions), and system design (decisions about where books and records reside and what the implications are for the bearer nature of the asset). An understanding of these underlying principles could also inform conversations with regulators and customers who are still getting up to speed on the technology.",
            "Given the fragmented nature of the current landscape, it will be important for these emerging leaders to develop an ecosystem strategy for off-the-shelf integrations into other (legacy) systems and partners. Very few asset owners are willing to engage eight different parties to tokenize an asset; the custody, distribution, trade, and servicing of these assets should be as simple as possible. Partnerships expanding distribution and access to investors can create meaningful strategic distance for an incumbent by helping such a company reach scale.",
            "Finally, institutions that are looking to have a leading position in tokenization should provide regulators with streamlined input about emerging standards to avoid further fragmentation of liquidity, data, and composability. Some examples of key areas where standard setting can be considered include controls (that is, appropriate governance, risk and control frameworks to protect end investors), custody (what constitutes qualified custody for tokenized assets on private networks, when to use digital-twin versus digital-native records, what constitutes a good control location), token design (what type of token standards and associated compliance engine to support), and blockchain support and data standards (what data are kept on chain versus off chain, reconciliation standards).",
            "This is not the first time an industry has attempted a shift to a more modern infrastructure. These shifts are always challenging, as it means running the old and new operating models in parallel for a while, which is hard to do when costs are in focus. Regulatory uncertainty only compounds the difficulty. However, given the potential benefits tokenization can bring to financial services, recent moves by leading incumbents suggest they may be up for the challenge, although it could take some time. Meanwhile, banks, asset managers, custodians, and others can take some no-regret moves today to prepare for this possibility of a tokenized worldâthe strategic optionality may be worth it after all.",

        "title": "Opening doors for women leaders: An interview with Caroline Feeney",
        "description": "As executive vice president and CEO of US businesses at Prudential, Caroline Feeney has found success by staying true to herself and helping others to climb the ladder.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " being a good leader means being authentic and empathetic. She has held several field leadership roles and in-house executive positions at Prudential and currently leads its US businesses. She has been included on ",
            "Most Powerful Women list and has been recognized in several notable publications for her leadership and accomplishments. Recently, McKinsey spoke to Feeney about her career path, her mentorship style, and the opportunities she sees for other women in the insurance industry. ",
            "Is there a key moment that helped you further your career and become a leader? ",
            " One defining moment for me was when I was asked to leave a comfortable position in the home office to go back into the field and lead our largest sales territory. I enjoyed the role I had, knew the job inside and out, and liked the people I worked with. I was comfortable.\n",
            "In the new role, the leadership team that would report to me was seasoned and predominately men. The position was highly results-focusedâso much so that senior leaders would receive a weekly scorecard on results in the territory, so it would quickly be clear whether you could execute or not. Iâd be lying if I said I wasnât a little scared. ",
            "To take that leap, I had to get out of my comfort zone, and it turned out to be one of the best moves I ever made. I learned more in that role than in any other role Iâve held. It also taught me the positive aspects of change and the importance of embracing fear when you are faced with a new challenge. That mindset helps us confront change head-on.  ",
            " What advice did your mentors give you throughout your career? ",
            " Iâve received a lot of great advice over the course of my career, and I try to pass it along to others. The best advice Iâve ever received is quite simple: âItâs never as good as it seems, and itâs never as bad as it seems.â Iâm the type of person who likes to prepare for things, such as events, and tends to overanalyze how they went after the fact. This advice is helpful because it helps put things into perspective and balances my expectations or assumptions with the reality of the situation. ",
            "Learning when not to take advice from someone is also important. Iâll give you an example. One male leader, who was trying to help, told me to lose my empathy gene because he thought it would make me tougher and, therefore, a better leader. I already knew at that point that empathy was a key element to how I led, and I believed it made me stronger and more in tune with my team, and helped me pick up on issues earlier. Years later, itâs quite clear that my decision to ignore that advice was the right one. Now, Iâll consider all advice, but I always use my own judgment to make sure itâs right for me. ",
            " What are the important qualities for leading during uncertain or challenging times? What important leadership styles do women bring? ",
            "When times are challenging or uncertain, the first thing we should think about is how weâre caring for our peopleâhow we are supporting them and communicating with them.",
            " Women bring a lot to the table as leaders in general and excel even more during challenging times. We can often bring a higher level of empathy to the equation, and that, plus strong communication skills, can go a long way. When times are challenging or uncertain, the first thing we should think about is how weâre caring for our peopleâhow we are supporting them and communicating with them. That connection was especially important when we were working remotely during the pandemic. ",
            "During challenging times, leaders should also spend more time motivating and inspiring others, making sure everyone feels connected to their companyâs purpose, and showing everyone how they fit in. Leaders especially need to show appreciation for their people when they are working under difficult conditions. Everyone handles changes and stressors in different ways: some may thrive, and others may find it difficult to adapt. Leaders must recognize these differences and find ways to help everyone move forward as comfortably as possible. Last, itâs important to always keep a positive tone and outlook, even when youâre not having the best day. That can entail adding an extra degree of transparency in what you communicate. ",
            " What leadership opportunities for women do you see in the insurance industry? What are the challenges the industry should address? What can be improved, and how? ",
            " I recall a study that found only one-third of respondents thought women had enough opportunities to reach the executive ranks. At the same time, the poll showed that many of the most desirable management characteristics were associated with female leadership, including accountability, fairness, open-mindedness, and communicativeness. So the skills that make good leaders are skills that many women tend to possess, but thereâs still a disconnect because women often lack opportunities to move into senior-level roles. ",
            "We need to attract and retain women, and then move them up through the ranks into profit-and-loss roles, because those are feeders for the C-suite. Itâs about building up your bench strength. As it stands, too many women drop off as directorsânot just in financial services but across every industry. To remedy this, ensuring equal opportunity for all employees is key. That comes in many different forms. First, itâs important that we look differently at the skills and qualifications we set up for a particular role: we have to move away from checking traditional boxes. Because the truth is, most of the boxes that weâre looking to check were created by men for men. ",
            "I believe companies have to ask themselves whether theyâre looking at performance and potential in the right way or if they are simply looking at the same qualifications theyâve always looked at. For example, maybe what we traditionally thought was important for a sales manager position, like sales experience, isnât as important as we thought; good leadership abilities may be more important, and the rest can be learned. ",
            "Similarly, we need to be intentional about finding opportunities for women who show potential and offer them stretch assignments, even when their current role or experience may not be an exact match. These are a few ways to build the pipeline that we need. ",
            " What advice would you give aspiring leaders, especially in the insurance industry and financial services? ",
            "Oftentimes the things youâre good at are also the things youâre most passionate about. Find out what those are, and try to make your role more about what you enjoy. ",
            " The first thing Iâd say is to leverage your strengths. Oftentimes the things youâre good at are also the things youâre most passionate about. Find out what those are, and try to make your role more about what you enjoy. On the flip side, you can work at the things you donât love to do or arenât great at, but you should also consider building a team with these complementary skill sets. As you spend more time doing the things you love, youâll find that you have more energy and can be even more successful. ",
            "Second, Iâd say be authentic. Being authentic at work isnât always easy, but itâs very powerful. Staying true to yourself is important as you navigate through your personal and professional life. I chose early on to embrace the fact that I am a woman leader, and that really helped me. I didnât try to be one of the guys, because I knew that if I did, Iâd have failed. Women overall are naturally more empathetic and have better listening and nurturing skills. Embrace that. Youâll be able to identify potential issues earlier, treat people how you would want to be treated, and build deeper relationships. ",
            "Third, Iâd say lead for the greater good. In business, weâre often all winning together or losing together, and winning is clearly more fun. So if you see a colleague struggling, itâs important to be willing to reach out and offer a helping hand. Think about the person who reached out to you and how it may have made all the difference in your successâI had plenty of people who helped me along the way. ",
            "Last, Iâd say get out of your comfort zone. When youâre tapped for an opportunity or project, do it. Even if you lack confidence in yourself, the person choosing you sees something in you that you should believe in. I think women tend to be more reticent in these situations than men, but it takes courage to go forward even if youâre afraid. And getting out of your comfort zone is critical to being successful and achieving your goals.",

Of the four archetypes, hyperscalers, or cloud-service providers that have already disrupted other industries, are changing industrial automation the most. Hyperscalers are moving into the embedded software and hardware part of the automation stack and are starting to grab a larger share of industrial automation spending. At an estimated 18 percent, the market for connectivity and industrial IoT (IIoT) will grow faster than any other part of the industrial automation market.

        "description": "Small and medium-size enterprises often struggle to find procurement cost savings. Yet there are ways to do it while still pursuing growth and providing a superior customer experience.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " that has confounded companies big and small: how can we reduce external spending without harming supply chains or sacrificing the quality of our products and services? The question becomes more relevant in times of economic uncertainty and high inflation as large companies take drastic cost-cutting measures such as reducing office space or scaling back on investments.",
            "While large companies can usually drive procurement cost savings with relative ease, small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) typically lack the necessary scale despite being the backbone of many economies around the world (see sidebar âThe critical role of SMEsâ). When it comes to procurement, SMEs often do not have the same purchasing power with suppliers that larger companies do because SMEs lack scale and often have a single source of supply, rendering them unable to seek pricing that is more competitive. Moreover, SMEs sometimes lack focus or the wherewithal required to rein in spendingâand when they do, value capture is often slow, prone to stagnation, and mostly ad hoc, resulting in incomplete, suboptimal, or even unintended outcomes.",
            " include a broad range of businesses that have revenues, assets, or a number of employees below defined thresholds. Each country has its own definition of what constitutes an SME. In the United States, the Small Business Administration (SBA) classifies small businesses according to their ownership structure, number of employees, earnings, and industry. For example, in manufacturing, an SME is a firm with 500 or fewer employees. SMEs generally exclude large multinationals, state-owned enterprises, and conglomerates.",
            "Despite their size, SMEs play an important role in the economy, employing large numbers of people and helping to shape innovation. According to the SBA, SMEs contributed 43.5 percent of US GDP in 2023, paid 39.4 percent of the countryâs private payroll, and created seven million more new jobs than large businesses did from 1995 to 2020.",
            " Governments regularly offer SMEs incentives, including favorable tax treatment and better access to loans, to help keep them in business.",
            "So what factors prevent SMEs from undertaking a procurement transformation that goes beyond spending cutsâone that helps simplify, realign, and strengthen the organization to help it grow and provide a better customer experience? Is there an approach or framework that SMEs can use to regain control of their budgets and external spending in a way that doesnât harm productivity or diminish morale? There isâas long as CFOs, chief procurement officers (CPOs), and COOs are willing to be innovative, make hard and timely decisions, and take necessary steps to transform their businesses.",
            "In the United States and Canada, according to McKinsey analysis of data from S&P Global, companies with less than $3 billion in revenue represent 86 percent of total enterprises and 26 percent of total revenue (Exhibit 1). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the largest corporations (those with annual revenues of more than $5 billion) contribute the biggest chunk of revenues, while those with annual revenues of less than $1 billion make up the largest group of companies.",
            "But while SMEs account for a significant slice of total revenue, a broad range of factors are limiting their ability to implement meaningful procurement cost savings in a way that not only boosts profits but also transforms companies along functional lines and prepares them for future shocks and economic downturns. Overcoming these limiting factors would be prudent, given the precedent set from 2017 to 2022, when smaller companies struggled most to maintain margins (Exhibit 2). The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent inflationary period have created challenges for companies of all sizes, but in aggregate, the biggest companies saw a much less dramatic drop in net income in comparison and have fully recovered or even exceeded prepandemic margin levels.",
            "With the benefit of hindsight, it would have been optimal for SMEs to have had cost-cutting and procurement strategies in place before the pandemic, cushioning the blow from disruption in supply chains. However, the following example of a midsize company that produces residential components and fortuitously initiated a cost transformation program right before the COVID-19 outbreak illustrates how SMEs can mitigate risk by using better procurement strategies.",
            "In this case, the company had long-term contracts in place for most of its business-critical external spending and reserved dedicated capacity with its top suppliers. It renegotiated better payment terms, identified and developed additional supplier sources to derisk its supply chain, and dynamically optimized sourcing decisions and logistics operations. These measures helped the company avoid some of the supply chain issues experienced by many SMEs during the pandemic. It also helped after COVID-19 containment measures were eased, when demand spiked and supplies ran short.",
            "Overall, we find that five major drivers often hold SMEs back: a lack of spending transparency, a myopic focus on the short term, talent gaps, underused digital tools and automation, and exclusion of procurement and supply chain in business decisions.",
            "Spending transparency means having full visibility into all relevant external expense information, revealed in a timely and systematic manner. While spending transparency is not new to the business sector, few SMEs adequately track and regularly reassess their spending. They often arenât equipped with a dynamic spending database to serve as the single source of truth for functions such as procurement. This is partly because small and midsize companies often underinvest in process improvement, have a plethora of legacy enterprise-resource-planning systems, or find implementation cost prohibitive. As a result, SMEs often fail to identify basic price variances, hurting competitiveness and margins. For example, margins for a midsize industrial company that operates in North America and Europe plateaued 30 to 40 percent below peer companies; inefficient sourcing was one of the major contributors to the companyâs margin reduction.",
            "Competitive procurement has its foundation in full spending transparency. Poor spending transparency can lead to value loss and ineffective budget management. With greater spending transparency, CPOs can effectively manage external costs, exercise greater control as the situation demands, and better understand risks to supply chains.",
            "SMEs often fail to identify basic price variances, hurting competitiveness and margins.",
            "Unlike large companies, which employ long-term strategies for most major spending categories, SMEs often fail to strategically align their business functions with procurement categories. Buyers focus the most on transactional efforts and work with single supplier sources with limited leverage and low committed volumes. As a result, supplier relationships tend to be transactional in nature as well and not focused on long-term partnerships, making suppliers reluctant to offer contracting discounts to SMEs. Moreover, the lack of a reliable demand forecast creates challenges for establishing longer-term cost savings. However, the deeper problem is centered on inefficient sales and operations planning, which directly affects supply chain strategy. SMEs could put more effort into planning and forecasting, which can enable long-term category and supply chain risk management.",
            "Itâs not uncommon for procurement managers at SMEs to spend most of their time dealing with supply disruptions. The cause of supply chain issues can be partially ascribed to a lack of the entrepreneurial or strategic mindset required to help derisk the supply chain. These issues can also be attributed to a lack of strategic direction at the executive levelâfor example, in setting target KPIs for the share of spending that is dual sourced or for average miles traveled for supplies. First and foremost, however, SMEs often face challenges in attracting the right talent.",
            "While a lack of brand recognition could hinder hiring, SMEs often source talent without a strategic mindset. When it comes to hiring for a procurement function, the experience and skill sets required to make a strategic impact are often not part of the job requirements. The traditional mindset of SMEs is that experience or exposure to a category family is the main requirement for category manager job candidates. To hire the best team, however, companies might consider candidates with track records of bringing about change at the organizations theyâve worked for or candidates with more diverse profiles that have skill sets outside traditional category management, such as data scientists, to find ways for procurement to drive broader business value.",
            "Procurement managers could also be empowered with greater analytics capabilities to address the complexities of their job. Along with buying roles, various other support roles could be introduced to best manage external spending. Data analysts, for example, could perform activities such as category analytics, spending intelligence, predictive analytics, and running advanced-analytics models of business relevance. Procurement organizations that are more advanced can even look to include software engineers and scrum masters to help develop customized automated business solutions, such as commodity indexing and forecasting supply chain disruptions.",
            "High-performing category managers at large organizations spend much of their time finding ways to propel value for the business through negotiations and supplier-sourced innovation. In contrast, category managers at SMEs tend to spend their days handling transactional work and managing disruptions. Inefficient workflow patterns at SMEs often evolve because repetitive processes are still carried out manually rather than being automated. In contrast, large companies have often digitalized procurement, thereby effectively managing costs and avoiding value loss. Legacy systems are still commonplace in SME organizations, and smaller companies often lack resources to continuously improve system infrastructure and tools.",
            "The role of CPO at many SMEs is still limited to category and supplier performance management. Accordingly, the CPOâs role in an organization should evolve to become that of business enabler and driver of customer value. The CPO should be a partner to engineering and marketing functions from early product development stages. The evolution of the role will require new skills, including strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities. A minor change in roles and responsibilities can not only help better manage cost of end products but also get an organization ready for the future.",
            " of spending and create cultures of continuous improvement, small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) need to overcome several major hurdles, which can take significant time. Successful SMEs often take several actions that span structure, operations, and strategy.",
            " A dedicated central team can help ensure cost transformation is realized. This team can manage an idea bank, set up idea generation sessions, organize regular troubleshooting meetings, organize governance meetings, conduct implementation follow-up sessions, and closely track achievement.",
            " A cost control cell is a governance team that reviews and approves all price changes.",
            " Implementation remains key to any transformation. We recommend holding regular governance sessions with middle and senior management.",
            " Continuous improvement requires a change in culture. Setting year-over-year cost savings targets is an important step on the transformation journey, helping to update the workflow of category managers, which involves moving from day-to-day management to proactive contract negotiations.",
            " An incentive plan acts as a key motivator for timely execution and helps justify the additional responsibility for managers.",
            " Effective data management is critical to sustainable cost improvement. Organizations can miss out on opportunities if a central repository is not maintained.",
            " With continuous changes in technology, it is important for teams to understand and leverage all available skills and resources.",
            "No easy fix exists when it comes to external spending optimizationâand addressing just one challenge is unlikely to make a transformative difference. However, five interconnected strategies can help SMEs identify procurement cost savings opportunities: establishing center of excellence (CoE) teams, improving forecasting, expanding the use of digital procurement tools, gaining greater market intelligence, establishing a culture of and processes for continuous cost optimization, and incorporating supplier-driven product improvements. In addition, SMEs can consider several structural changesâsome that would echo those of their larger corporate counterparts, and others that would capitalize on the strengths of SMEs (see sidebar âFurther actions to enable next-gen procurementâ).",
            "Establishing a CoE team to support sourcing teams is now the norm at advanced procurement organizations. The focus of CoE teams is to empower buyers with deep category analytics and negotiation support. They perform category market analysis and supplier profiling, create fact packs and negotiation playbooks for supplier discussions, and develop component âshould costâ models to provide greater cost transparency and buying leverage. One reason for value loss at procurement organizations is a lack of understanding of the full opportunity potential for a supplier and supporting facts during price negotiations. CoE teams can lay the groundwork for establishing short- and long-term strategies at the category and commodity levels.",
            "A dedicated centralized planning team that works with the procurement team can be another value add and can forecast demand at the SKU, business unit, or product levels, with input from operations and marketing. Furthermore, they can provide transparency in future award timing and volumes. Suppliers become long-term partners with a stable forecast of business and are more willing to collaborate with companies to find cost opportunities. The planning team can also answer questions about minimizing risk through dual sourcing versus single sourcing of components, request-for-quotation strategies and frequencies, annual negotiations, and local sourcing versus best-cost country sourcing.",
            "Digital tools can help make processes more effective and efficient by improving communication and efficiency across operations while reducing the manual workload on procurement managers. Digital procurement tools are also affordable and can elevate the standards of SMEs to match large corporations in terms of internal capability. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to digital procurement, successful organizations are experimenting with digital innovation, sometimes designing custom solutions. Examples of leading digital procurement tools include spend intelligence tools, e-sourcing solutions, e-auctions, parametric should-cost models, automated contract analysis and management, and negotiation simulation for capability building.",
            "Investment in digital tools can also prepare SMEs for long-term sustainable operational efficiencies while keeping their spending in check. Taking a more data-driven approach, especially for SME manufacturing organizations, has exponential benefits because digital applications can play a major role. For example, e-auctionsâonline auctions with potential suppliersâhelp eliminate the need for multiple rounds of negotiation with suppliers and increase transparency of the business award process for both buyers and suppliers.",
            "Market intelligence can include product changes, supplier market dynamics, material price changes, tariff changes, global and national policy changes, total capacity utilization, currency fluctuations, and other variables. For example, by carefully tracking market fluctuations, SMEs can prepare buying strategies that are more resilient in the face of external disruption. Market intelligence can also lead to greater transparency with core supplier partners, empowering buyer organizations and providing greater visibility to suppliers, which are focused on growth and future readiness.",
            "For instance, a North American SME used market intelligence to develop a cost savings model to aid in the procurement of steel for fabricating products, sourced from countries across Asia and Latin America. The model used different indexes (such as freight and raw material) to provide data on the best total landed cost for steel products from various suppliers and is now considered by category managers to be a robust solution for making informed supply chain decisions.",
            "Large organizations work to generate cultures that encourage continuous cost optimization. SMEs could start by holding internal workshops at regular intervals to create âidea banksâ that map out opportunities. These workshops can be run at the product family or supplier level.",
            "Companies will likely find it necessary to work closely with their long-standing supplier partners to find procurement cost savings, given the impact of component price on margin and, ultimately, what the customer pays.",
            "At the same time, SMEs could define their own procurement cost-cutting programs and communicate these programs to internal stakeholders, including product design, manufacturing, and quality teams, to identify potential opportunities to reduce costs. Companies will likely find it necessary to work closely with their long-standing supplier partners to find procurement cost savings, given the impact of component price on margin and, ultimately, what the customer pays. SMEs have limited resources available, so prioritizing efforts to capture the value identified is necessary. SME leaders might also consider a five-step âescalatory ladderâ to generate fast procurement savings with minimal effort (Exhibit 3).",
            "Developing an âexternal spend cubeââthat is, a structured data set of the firmâs spending patterns with external suppliersâand a specification library for top procurement categories could also help when establishing a cost savings performance baseline, generating cost-saving ideas, shaping category strategy, and identifying synergies across business units. Companies can define short-term and long-term opportunities by category and develop an understanding of the effort required to carry them out. As savings accrue, companies can focus their attention on the sustainability of savings through cost control cells and governance mechanisms dictated by upper management.",
            "More SMEs could work with their suppliers to drive product improvement. As many companies look to outsource their manufacturing and maintain only key process steps in-house, suppliers now have a significant stake in the end product. Therefore, it is important to involve suppliers in product development and enhance the free flow of ideas about product improvement. SMEs can entice supplier participation in product optimization programs through an incentive program, which shares the gains of supplier-driven initiatives with the supplier.",
            "Not only can a program optimize specification, but overall, products can also be improved by supplier-side innovations. For example, suppliers for an industrial-machinery manufacturer suggested that the manufacturer adopt new compressor technology. Newer compressors were energy efficient but came at a slight premium. But in the long run, the new compressors helped the company to differentiate its product offering and entice new customers.",
            "Cost transformation is never easy, especially for SMEs. It requires a concerted effort on the part of CFOs, CPOs, and even CEOs. However, if done correctlyâfocused particularly on procurement automation, strategic sourcing, and structural changesâcost transformation can generate significant savings and boost profits. But for organizations to make meaningful, effective change, they must stay ahead of the curve. Simply responding to crises and wielding the budget knife, without ensuring business units are aligned and implementing improved processes, will only postpone what needs to be done.",

        "description": "What can help European countries move the needle as the labor shortage worsens and inflation and costs rise? Investing in new tech, talent, and products; programmatic M&A; and decarbonization.",
        "paragraphs": [
            "continues to operate within an uncertain and volatile macroeconomic environment characterized by the ongoing war in Ukraine, the resulting energy crisis, and persistent supply chain challenges. Some companies have fared better than others. Our research suggests companies that weathered the crisis of 2020 were able to solidify their advantages, emerge stronger than before, and deliver sustained growth in the subsequent two years.",
            "The road ahead offers both new challenges and new opportunities for the machinery industry. A solid order intake for the future indicates continued demand for machinery products and services. However, profitability is again under pressure, largely because inflation is raising material costs and consequently the cost of goods sold.",
            "To stay competitive, European machinery companies will need to address the growing labor shortage by attracting, developing, and retaining skilled talent. They will also need to spur technological innovation at scale and at pace, decarbonize, and shift toward sustainable energy sources. A programmatic M&A strategy can advance these efforts, enable the digitalization needed to implement improvements, and support integrated solutions and services to unlock potential recurring revenue streams and create additional value for customers and companies alike.",
            "This article is based on data from the 2023 McKinsey Machinery Benchmark, which has been collecting data from more than 100 European machinery companies since 2013. Extracted and double-checked from verified sources such as annual reports, the high-quality data in the benchmark includes all major income-statement and balance-sheet items, selected cash-flow elements, and data points such as head counts and share prices.",
            "McKinseyâs Machinery Benchmark finds that across multiple financial and operational metrics, European machinery companies are on a slower trajectory than their North American counterparts (see sidebar âAbout the researchâ). Despite strong revenue growth, the European sector has lagged behind in margin growth, M&A activity, and productivity (Exhibit 1).",
            "European and North American machinery companies have continued a revenue growth trajectory following the initial disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Revenues in the European sector increased by roughly 18 percent in 2022, while the North American sectorâs annual revenue grew at a stable but much more modest 7 percent.",
            "While both regions experienced strong margin recovery in 2021, the two regions diverged, slightly but significantly, in 2022. In Europe, EBIT margins fell by roughly 1.3 percentage points to around 8.6 percent.",
            " In North America, companies experienced a slightly smaller decline of around 0.7 percentage points but sustained strong EBIT margins around 10.4 percent. The drop in EBIT margins for both regions was roughly half of the drop that occurred during the initial COVID-19 disruptions in 2020.",
            "Only 40 percent of the companies in our benchmark managed to improve their margins in 2022, and about three-quarters of these same companies also delivered margin improvements in 2021. This suggests that companies that successfully bounced back from the immediate aftermath of the pandemic were able to sustain profitable growth through 2022. We expect this trend to continue, and to affect European and North American players equally.",
            "After a sharp drop in the second half of 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, M&A and divestiture activity rebounded within a year (Exhibit 2). At times, M&A and divestiture activity has even surpassed prepandemic levels, with more than 50 mergers and acquisitions recorded during some quarters in 2021 and 2022. A closer look at the regional distribution reveals a correlation between M&A activity and margin performance. In particular, the Nordic countries and North America have a similar rate of M&A activity and, as discussed in the foregoing section of this article, a similar upward trajectory in margin development. This suggests that continuous M&A supports margin resilience. Divestitures, on the other hand, have no obvious link to geographic regions. The North American companies in our benchmark lead on divestitures for the most part, with the highest share among their peers. This suggests a greater openness toward divestitures in North America and a tendency to protect the core business in Europe.",
            "North American inventory ratios remain stable around 19 percent, but a decline of inventory stockpiles is expected by the end of 2023.",
            " European players, on the other hand, continued to build up their inventories, reaching an average of almost 23 percent in 2022âan increase of around two percentage points. This is the highest inventory ratio since 2015, the year we began tracking this metric.",
            "Average productivity in the European machinery sector increased by almost 10 percent from 2021 to 2022, following an 8 percent increase during the previous year.",
            " Less than 10 percent of the firms in our benchmark reported a decline in productivity. North American players also reported strong productivity growth of 9.5 percent, on the heels of 9.0 percent growth in the previous year. This is a positive development for both regions, especially in light of ongoing labor shortages, and affirms that they have the capacity to overcome production delays and avoid order backlogs.",
            "German machinery players delivered strong revenue growth of 13 percent from 2021 to 2022.",
            " However, EBIT margins fell by 0.6 percentage points, following a significant recovery in the previous year. Rising costs are likely responsible for the margin pressure: cost of goods sold increased to 70.5 percent, on average, an increase of nearly 0.5 percentage points from 2021. The average material cost ratio (as a share of revenue) also increased by nearly one percentage point to 49.5 percent in the same period. Average SG&A costs, on the other hand, declined below prepandemic levels to slightly less than 16 percent. Meanwhile, R&D ratio (an indicator of innovation activity) declined to roughly 4 percent in 2022, suggesting that innovation has ramped down in the past year.",
            "The inventory ratio for German machinery companies increased for the fifth year in a row, likely in response to persistent supply chain disruptions facing the global economy. Now that current inventory ratios have reached more than 23 percent, the industry can turn toward other levers, such as production process design, to build resilience and future-proof German companies.",
            "The business climate for German machinery and equipment manufacturing declined by 5.5 balance points in March and again by 11.9 balance points in June 2023.",
            " Business expectations for the next six months dropped further by almost 20 balance points to â21 balance points. In March there was a significant improvement of expectations, registered by an increase of 15.2 points to a slightly negative balance point of â2.0.",
            "Despite the increase in productivity for machinery players in the benchmark, order backlogs have continued to increase (Exhibit 3). The rise in incoming orders after a pandemic-related drop in orders led to a spike in backlog, which was exacerbated by labor and supply shortages. The German machinery industryâs order backlog began to rise in 2020 and reached an all-time high in late 2022. By April 2023, order intake had dropped significantly, by 25 percent, similar to the drop experienced during the pandemic. Though this drop will temporarily help ease the backlog, the long-term solution is to mitigate Germanyâs labor shortage (see sidebar âSpotlight on the German machinery sectorâ).",
            "Increasing the supply of qualified skilled labor is essential to the future of manufacturing in Europe. Automation continues to displace workers in some sectors and heighten the need for machinery workers trained to operate, service, and optimize robots and other advanced technology. The rising pressure to innovate in what is becoming an increasingly commoditized market means machinery players must compete for tech talent. And, as efforts to achieve net-zero targets intensify, companies must equip themselves to not only lower their operating emissions but also contribute low- and zero-carbon products and services.",
            "The global manufacturing sector continues to grapple with a widespread labor shortage. In the European region, the number of open jobs rose by approximately 70 percent between 2020 and 2022.",
            " Since the beginning of 2022, this number has hovered slightly above 500,000 vacancies.",
            "The German machinery sector alone had approximately 250,000 vacancies in 2022âan increase of more than 100 percent from the previous year. Despite the staggering demand, the number of young people in Germany without the minimum education required for many career paths remained stable at 6 percent from 2011 to 2021 (Exhibit 4).",
            " This labor shortage has significant implications for the future of the sector, which requires a highly skilled workforce to operate and innovate at pace. Manufacturing vacancies as a share of total vacancies in Germany also increased between 2020 and 2022, rising by more than ten percentage points from an already high share of 38 percent to almost 50 percent.",
            "The vacancy situation in Europe varies significantly by country. For instance, in the Czech Republic, the country with the second-highest number of manufacturing vacancies, the absolute vacancy level remained stable between 2020 and 2022, leading to a decrease in the relative share of vacancies.",
            " This means that the Czech Republic can acquire talent for open positions while continuing to grow.",
            "Education and training programs can help address the shortage of skilled workers in the machinery sector, improve the quality of products and services, and spur economic growth and development. In particular, machinery companies and associations can experiment with specialized programs to recruit and integrate workers without traditional educational credentials, who represent an untapped source of potential talent.",
            "Europeâs wave of innovation continued in 2022. After a slight decline over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of patent applications submitted to the European Patent Office (EPO) increased by more than 2.5 percent to more than 193,000âsurpassing the record set the previous year.",
            " However, the overall number of patents granted by the EPO fell to 81,754, leaving many submitted innovations unrecognized and unprotected.",
            " No country in our benchmark maintained its pre-2022 level of granted patents.",
            " Of the top ten countries, Chinaâs decline in granted patents was the smallest at around 15 percent, while Japanâs decline was the largest, at almost 30 percent.",
            "While Germany remains the second-largest patent initiator in Europe (in absolute numbers), its share of patents fell by 4.7 percent between 2021 and 2022,",
            " and its R&D ratio has fallen each year since 2020. Some European regions, such as the Nordics and Switzerland, maintained a steady R&D ratio during the same period.",
            "In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes provisions to expand domestic manufacturing capacity by encouraging investment; boost purchases of critical supplies from domestic or free-trade partners; and advance R&D and deployment for carbon capture and storage (CCUS), clean hydrogen, and other innovative climate technologies.",
            " To maintain their competitive edge in innovation, Germany machinery players should reevaluate their current R&D strategies, especially as growing labor and energy costs place them at a disadvantage relative to companies in other regions.",
            "Globally, the number of patents for specialized machines decreased by 1.8 percent in 2022.",
            " The Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark, and Finland rank in the top five in our benchmark for the number of patent applications as a share of population.",
            " Switzerland remains the undisputed leader, with more than twice as many applications as second-ranked Sweden.",
            " Trends in Europe have been promising, but patent issue growth in the past decade has been inconsistent. Only China and Denmark have experienced stable growth in the number of issued patents across all major sectors (Exhibit 5). This trend is particularly concerning for Germany, where average growth in the number of patents issued has remained low in most machinery categories, with the exception of handling and other machines. China, on the other hand, has experienced high growth in all categories except textiles, machine tools, and paper machinery.",
            "Because the labor shortage is the bottleneck for the machinery industryâs output, companies remain focused on securing talent as well as seeking opportunities to automate production. The digital space, meanwhile, remains largely untapped, despite its potential to help create value and new revenue streams.",
            "Innovation will be a strategic differentiating factor for European companies in the future as companies based in regions with lower operating costs continue to improve on product quality metrics.",
            "Along with raw materials, energy is a vital input to production in the machinery sector. Every process, from forming and forging to milling, is energy intensive. Because of the complexity and variety of parts in machines, the cumulative energy demand is considerable. Given the push toward decarbonization, access to sustainable energy is poised to become a key differentiator in the next few years.",
            "European countries rank first in the world for share of sustainable energy relative to total energy production.",
            " Within Europe, Norway and Denmark lead, generating 98.6 percent and 85.8 percent of their energy from renewable sources, respectively, followed by Sweden at 63.2 percent, Finland at 59.8 percent, and Switzerland at 59.1 percent. In contrast, China has a roughly 27 percent renewable-energy share, and the United States trails at 22 percent (Exhibit 6).",
            "The adoption of sustainable production is a necessary step across all industries to meet 2050 net-zero-emissions targets.",
            " Sustainability not only provides a reputation boost for companies that offer low-carbon products but can also improve quality across all products in a portfolio. This long-term trend toward product improvement can in turn support the opportunity for price premiums and more resilient margins in the future.",
            "As machinery and industrial companies embrace science-based targets and make bold net-zero commitments, reducing carbon emissions becomes a nearer-term endeavor (Exhibit 7). Machinery leaders need to incorporate a sustainability perspective into their strategic decisions about sourcing parts or about where production facilities should be located.",
            "As mentioned previously, M&A activity correlates with margin improvements. And McKinsey empirical research analyzing 20 years of data has shown that programmatic M&A, compared with other approaches to M&A, carries significantly lower risk and is more likely to enhance performance.",
            " Programmatic M&A strategy is organized around a central business case or theme and involves acquiring meaningful total market capitalization through at least three deals each year.",
            "European leaders will need to leverage programmatic M&A to form partnerships that close the capability gap and keep the machinery sector on the leading edge of technological innovation. They must also invest in innovation governance and capabilities at scale and at pace. This means implementing agile practices and customer-centric approaches to manage high-risk, long-term projects. Companies will need to raise or reallocate funds for long-term innovation and business development on a larger scale than ever before. And just as important, they will need to build the skills and the capabilities to innovate.",
            "The European machinery sector cannot afford to lag behind on innovation. A 2022 McKinsey Global Institute analysis revealed that Europe leads on only two of ten transversal technologiesâtechnologies that span sectorsâthat will shape the global competitive landscape of the future.",
            " These technologies are characterized by their relevance across all major sectors in terms of their disruptive potential and include applied AI, distributed infrastructure, next-generation computing, and bio revolution. European machinery companies will need to invest in transversal technology sectors such as next-level process automation and the future of connectivity to become global technology leaders in the decades ahead.",
            "Partnerships with technology organizations and experts not only address the machinery sectorâs shortage of transversal technology skills but also provide a competitive edge in attracting skilled labor. These collaborations enable more efficient digitalization as well as access to external knowledge and expertise, ensuring sustained competitiveness in the ever-evolving digital economy. Additionally, such partnerships play a crucial role in driving innovation toward decarbonization of machinery products, leading to significant reductions in emissions (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) across both the machinery sector and the industries it serves. Engaging low-carbon and carbon-neutral companies in regions rich in renewable energy sources may soon become a higher priority than labor and other operating costs.",
            "Programmatic M&A can help to scale and expand the core business and can succeed even under seemingly adverse conditions. As McKinsey has outlined elsewhere, there are four approaches to deploying programmatic M&A.",
            " Machinery companies can yield considerable benefit by applying these approaches:",
            "Labor shortages and global economic volatility notwithstanding, European machinery players have options available to address present challenges while strengthening the entire sector for the long term. Investments in education, training, new products, and renewable energy can help them realize fundamental, global goals of expanding the employment pipeline and achieving net-zero emissions. Companies that deploy such investments strategically, bolstering them with programmatic M&A, can fast-track innovation and forge new paths to growth.",

            "offers tremendous opportunities for machinery and equipment manufacturers to weather setbacks and disruptions while still innovating and improving operations. The idea of implementing organization-wide digitalization may seem daunting. But available cloud-based solutions provide organizations of all sizes with the customizable services, expertise, and connectivity they need to digitalize at scale. Large cloud-service providersâknown as hyperscalersâhave already built ecosystems that companies can leverage to greatly expand their capabilities and options. Hyperscalersâ solutions seamlessly integrate with their partnersâ solutions in these ecosystems, giving companies the support of system integrators and independent software vendors during implementation.",
            "These benefits are why leading manufacturing companies use cloud-supported digitalization to address the same challenges the machinery sector faces: inflation; chronic talent shortages; and higher energy, materials, and labor costs. Digital technology is also helping companies advance their net-zero objectives.",

We highlight examples of leading-edge organizations that optimized their operations and strengthened their resilience with digitally enhanced supply chains, production, product development, aftersales, and more.",
            "As promising and potentially beneficial as it is, the expansive, evolving array of data, connectivity, analytics, humanâmachine interaction, and robotics solutions available in the machinery sector can feel overwhelming. Manufacturers are often tempted to dip their toes into the Industry 4.0 pool rather than dive into the deep end with an organization-wide digital transformation. But a piecemeal approach to digitalization can put machinery and equipment manufacturers at risk of falling into the âpilot purgatoryâ trap that afflicts many companiesâ Industry 4.0 endeavors: companies see promising results from early trials of new digital approaches but cannot scale their successes due to technical, organizational, or capability constraints.",
            "Digital transformation is no longer optional for machinery sector companies seeking to differentiate themselves and gain an edge on their competition. According to a 2020 survey by VDMA and McKinsey on customer-centric digital platforms in mechanical engineering, machine availability and machine performance are the top priorities of both end users and machinery companies.",
            " And while applying digital approaches at sufficient scale to achieve a significant impact on EBIT is not a trivial task, holistic digitalization is precisely what is needed to realize this impact. The gains in insight, efficiency, productivity, communication, and customer satisfaction achieved by fully digitalized companies are symbiotic, not independent. Digitalization enables the analysis that provides the insights, which inform the decisions and innovations that lead to great efficiency, higher production, and so on.",

According to a 2020 survey by VDMA and McKinsey on customer-centric digital platforms in mechanical engineering, machine availability and machine performance are the top priorities of both end users and machinery companies.",
            "Implementing digital use cases at scale requires a scope that encompasses the whole company, committed senior-management leadership, and a relentless focus on rapid and meaningful business impact. Successful transformations emphasize the creation of an environment capable of supporting and sustaining digital initiativesâfor example, with a robust technology infrastructure, the systematic acquisition and development of digital skills, and the creation of a digital-first organizational culture and mindset.",
            "Indeed, drawing upon McKinseyâs experience with at-scale digital transformations across sectors, implementing organization-wide digitalization with cloud applications and a portfolio of digital tools could improve a machinery manufacturerâs EBIT by as much as five to eight percentage points (Exhibit 1). Automations, improvements in data analysis, and more can increase efficiencies and free up employees to focus on higher-level improvements that lead to further savings and product innovations. These efficiencies could yield cost savings of up to 20 percent in some functional areas. General and administrative expenses could be reduced by 10 to 20 percent by implementing, for example, a digital spend control tower (SCT) or robotic process automation (RPA) for enterprise resource planning (ERP).",

            "Machine learning and AI-powered processes can enable improvements in production as well as product quality, both of which can lead to increased revenue. New revenue streams could also be created by using cloud-assisted digital systems to provide predictive maintenance as a service for manufactured machinery and equipment. And the time is ripe for machinery and equipment sector players to explore the service-centered offerings that digital transformation makes possible. For many companies, automated systems will account for 25 percent of capital spending over the next five years, as shown in the 2022 McKinsey Global Industrial Robotics Survey.",
            "Digital transformations can take different forms, but they tend to afford common benefits across three broad dimensions: business focus, digital capabilities, and cross-functional scalability.",
            "Companies that scale digitalization successfully view digitalizing as an investment in their future growth and profitability rather than as an IT project. Such organizations apply a broad portfolio of use cases driven by their respective business, following a careful prioritization based on business impact, feasibility, and ease of implementation. For example, digitally enabled automation can yield higher productivity that can offset higher material costs and economic volatility. Automating repetitive, monotonous tasks can help retain talent in manufacturing by reducing employee stress; it can also attract new talent with opportunities that appeal to digital natives.",
            "Digital transformation requires systematic changes across an organization. Successfully digitalized companies approach their transformations as multiyear journeys. Leaders drive the transformations, but they are supported by a central transformation engine that guides change efforts for individual units, monitors progress, and ensures best practices are adopted universally. Companies invest in digital talent by hiring new employees with specific skills and by running large-scale capability-building programs to rapidly upskill existing staff. The resulting organizations are more efficient, productive, and able to engage in proactive efforts to innovate and improve and reactive efforts to adapt to external factors and course correct when needed.",
            "Because digital transformation requires an organization-wide approach to technology, companies that scale digitalization successfully develop dozens of different digital-tool use cases and build the most effective applications on a common infrastructure that is scalable, affordable, and secure. To implement, sustain, and develop this infrastructure, companies typically forge strategic partnerships with key technology players. These partnerships complement and augment internal resources, creating additional capacity and opportunities to scale.",
            "Once core elements are in place, machinery and equipment manufacturers can accelerate their digital efforts, identifying and capturing multiple opportunities to boost their performance. Mastery of the digital toolbox could unlock sources of future growth. Effective remote-monitoring and diagnostic capabilities, for example, can enable a shift to new machinery-as-a-service business models in which companies own, operate, and maintain equipment on their customersâ behalf.",
            "Cloud-based solution platforms can make it much easier for organizations engaging in digital transformation to prioritize efforts that help differentiate them from competitors (Exhibit 2). Using a cloud solution to manage a supply chain, for example, can make it more efficient. Or, rather than resourcing the creation of a new algorithm for a machine-learning platform, a manufacturer could apply the cloud solution providerâs algorithm to address its challenges. And rather than adapting to working with an ecosystem of software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers or integrating it into their systems, a manufacturer could engage a cloud hyperscaler with a technology platform that has been integrated at scale with several organizations.",

            "Cloud capabilities open up an important potential source of revenue in the machine and equipment sector: the equipment-as-a-service (EaaS) model. This business model gives OEMs a way to satisfy customersâ increasing preference to operationalize their equipment expenses and reduce their capital expenditures. The EaaS model benefits customers by supplying them with rented equipment as part of a service that includes software updates, spare-part replacements, and predictive maintenance. And OEMs and manufacturers benefit from increased access to machine data and customers, which can lead to additional revenue.",
            "Cloud-based tools and services are helping companies to reduce the environmental impact of their manufacturing operations in numerous ways. Supply chain digitalization, for example, makes it possible to pinpoint emissions sources, thereby reducing waste, emissions, and energy consumption and production. An optimally digitalized supply chain, in turn, enables faster, cheaper production while supporting, rather than sacrificing, sustainability. And smarter product development aided by digitalization results in new generations of inherently more sustainable products. The application of cloud providersâ tools for process control and quality validation can also help reduce defects and scrap. And advanced scheduling optimization can even allow companies to plan energy-intensive activities for times when low-carbon power from renewable sources is plentiful.",
            "By migrating to cloud-based systems, machinery sector companies can reduce their reliance on physical infrastructure and minimize energy consumption, resulting in a smaller carbon footprint. Moreover, cloud-based platforms enable better tracking and traceability of products, allowing companies to monitor and manage their environmental impact throughout the value chain.",
            "A few of the numerous sustainability gains the cloud could help machinery sector players realize are detailed below.",
            "As companies intensify their efforts to hit increasingly aggressive Scope 3 emission-reduction targets, they put pressure on their machinery and equipment providers to demonstrate a clear roadmap for net-zero operations. Cloud capabilities can help machinery sector companies contribute to these objectives by allowing them to measure and support sustainability across their value chain (see sidebar, âCloud-powered sustainability solutionsâ).",
            "Digital supply chains revolutionize business operations by providing unparalleled advantages in todayâs interconnected landscape. Enabled by technologies such as cloud computing, AI, and blockchain, digital supply chains offer real-time visibility from sourcing to delivery. This transparency allows organizations to identify bottlenecks, optimize inventory, and make data-driven decisions. Moreover, digital supply chains enable a swift response to disruptions, whether caused by natural disasters, supplier issues, or market fluctuations. Savings on materials costs can, for example, be realized with AI-based supplier benchmarking that compares suppliersâ performance on metrics most important to a given manufacturer or by using AI to predict a need for spare parts.",
            "One global electronics manufacturer, for example, used digital-supply-chain risk-management tools to minimize supply disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic. The manufacturer had a global manufacturing network of around a dozen plants. It created a digital model of its entire supply chainâand a large multitiered supply base with more than 5,000 suppliersâand used the model to assess the supply chainâs relative vulnerability across multiple factors such as lead time, supplier concentration, COVID-19-specific country risk, and financial resilience. This effort identified more than a hundred priority high-risk suppliers, of which around 10 percent were either financially distressed or previously unknown tier-two suppliers. Detailed review of those suppliers allowed the manufacturer to implement a mitigation plan that reduced its spending at high-risk suppliers by more than 40 percent.",

To improve its planning and scheduling processes, the company developed a mathematical model of its entire production process. The model included all relevant constraints and cost driversâ45 nodes, 80 flows, and 50 technical constraintsâand was used to build an optimization tool that helped the company achieve a 25 percent increase in throughput. The cloud made it possible to break down data silos and provide a single, uniform source of the data needed for the model, as well as the computing power needed to run it.",

Companies can also benefit from AI-based product-complexity management: for example, one power tool manufacturer realized a 20 percent reduction in processing time, an improvement of more than $20 million in operating margin, and a more than 40 percent reduction in its finished goodsâ SKU count.",
            "A company in the power generation equipment sector is using AI to optimize the design of large turbines for hydroelectric plants. In a pilot project, the companyâs engineering team partnered with external specialists to create a deep-learning model (enabled by robust cloud-based computing) that simulated the performance of the four major components in its turbines. The model was designed to accept the desired operating point as an input and considers different constraintsâfrom the acceptable mass and strength of each part to fluid flow problems such as cavitation or pressure pulsation. Using this approach, the company reduced the engineering hours required to create a new turbine design by 50 percent and cut the end-to-end design process by 25 percent. Better still, the approach generated turbines that were up to 0.4 percentage points more efficient than conventional designs, an improvement that could be worth millions of dollars to the operator over the lifetime of a power plant.",

            " chair and CEO of Coherent, formerly II-VI, has spent a lifetime building businesses by harnessing breakthrough technologies. At Coherent, he has championed a strategy focused on acquisitions to achieve scale and deliver innovations in the industrial, communications, electronics, and instrumentation markets. McKinseyâs AndrÃ© Andonian and Abhijit Mahindroo sat down with him to discuss the lessons he has learned and his plans for the future. An edited version of the conversation follows.",
            " Chuck, you spent almost equal amounts of time at AT&T Bell Laboratories and then II-VI, now Coherent. What are the biggest lessons youâve learned?",
            " I started at Bell in advanced materials and the semiconductor device laboratory, with a great interest in making devices that would allow people to get closer to each other. It was the largest industrial research lab then, with more than 25,000 people and 15,000 PhDs. There was expertise in basically every important technology. I learned a lot about culture, organization, people, technology, and business at such a large company. So when I joined II-VI, which was a totally different scale, I was interested in how innovation happened in a small one.",
            "Innovation in a large company allows lots of technology options to be advanced. And integrating those fundamental technologies enabled it to bring breakthrough solutions to market and scale them quickly.",
            "At Coherent, over the past 20 years, we have acquired more than 20 companies. We have learned a lot about integrating technologies and organizing management and talent. We also learned how to incorporate innovation, curiosity, and imagination into a product portfolio based on advanced materials.",
            " II-VI began as a specialized materials company and now, as Coherent, has many technology platforms in multiple verticals and end markets. How did this happen?",
            " It happened through innovation, imagination, and an aspiration to enable the world to be safer, healthier, closer, and more efficientâwhich, in fact, is our mission. When I joined, the companyâs core activity was making CO2 laser optics and materials for components for cutting and welding steel. But we set out to become a global company through acquisition and investment. More than 20 acquisitions later, we are a $5 billion company.",
            " Coherent is a unique company dealing with photons and electrons. Why is this important?",
            " The foundation of all our businesses lies in advanced materials. Electrons and photons are fundamental particles of the universe. And for a materials company that delivers, among other things, lasers and electronics, they are essential to everything we do. At the end of the day, the most basic physical processes we use and harness involve generating and collecting photons. These come about by way of very specialized physical processes within the atom. Likewise, electrons play an important role in imparting physical properties to our semiconductor materials and systems, including the laser, but also semiconductor-powered electronics.",
            " Coherent plays in the value chain from components and modules to subsystems and potentially even to systems. At the same time, its businesses serve both internal and external customers. What drives this strategy?",
            " It is a great question because people often ask about our vertically integrated strategy. When we think about investments, we ask ourselves some basic questions: One, what is our value proposition? Two, what core competencies do we have or need to fulfill that value proposition? And three, what are our sources of sustainable competitive advantage? Building a vertically integrated business on a materials foundation has allowed us to expand the range and complexity of our offeringsâand to anticipate customer requirements and incorporate them into our products.",

            "In moving from materials to components, to subsystems, and now with Coherent, these four levels of integration mean we can manage the value chain to deliver to our customers exactly what they need.",
            "A vertically integrated model of serving businesses allows us to accelerate time to market and make efficient use of the assets. As a manufacturing company, our investments in R&D and manufacturing must make a decent return. So it is like a symphony inside the company as we grow. Conducting and synchronizing that symphony is partly how we compete and why it is difficult to keep up with us.",
            " Building on this symphony idea, you are continuously expanding the orchestra and the types of music that Coherent can produce. How do you develop this strategy? And how do you capture the full potential of these transactions?",
            " The process for the strategy involves a lot of people. It starts with a management decision to invest in markets that will sustain the companyâs growth, allow us to define a leadership position, and continue to generate long-term stakeholder value. It involves all our people, our investors, the communities that we operate in, and our aspiration to change the world.",
            "Our board has been engaged in a review process since the company was founded more than 50 years ago. Their process of questioning, challenging, and refining has served the company extremely well.\nSo, strategy starts with deciding what to do and what not to do. And those have been important moments for us, including when we had to step back and ask ourselves, âWhat aspects of our strategy are not working?â",
            " Coherent operates in many different countries. How do you ensure there is alignment between leaders and employees? And how do you create such a strong culture?",
            " We operate today in 18 countries and 78 locations. But I think the transparency of our purpose, mission, and values has generated a deep foundation of trust. That trust has allowed us to move faster than our competitors in deciding and executing.",

            " Over the past two years, tremendous uncertainty and geopolitical risk have buffeted the global economy. How can multinational corporations think about navigating such uncertainty?",
            " Our willingness to focus on a bold path forward has always challenged us to assess risk and put a risk management framework in place. I think our diversification, global footprint, and ability to communicate have created a strong foundation of trust that has allowed us to operate in the face of the pandemic and other challenges. Also, we are helped by having a diversified global leadership team of people who have been willing to stay with us.",
            " One of the biggest challenges of our times is sustainability. How does Coherent contribute to addressing this?",
            " Our vision is a world transformed through innovative materials vital to the sustainability of future generations. We are a leading supplier of communications, computing, and consumer electronics, and these technologies have brought the world together, held it together, and allowed it to become more efficient. In addition, we have set our organization up to deliver long-term sustainable value, including in the electrification of transportation, where we are a leading innovator in silicon carbide power electronics.",
            " How do you retain personal and institutional creativity and that of the institution over such a long period?",
            " I have to do more and more through other people. I focus on inspiring, sparking, challenging, establishing, and encouraging people to move quickly, avoid hidden biases, and fail early and often. My passion for watching people learn and grow has only deepened as the company has expanded.",
            " Talent is a major differentiator for long-term success. What approach do you take to attracting, retaining, and developing the best talent for Coherent?",
            " At AT&T Bell Laboratories, I learned that high-tech people in a high-tech company, as well as enabling functions, have two things in common: they want exciting and challenging jobs and a manager, a leader, or a group of people around them who know more than they do and can help them. Their autonomy gives them a sense of purpose and allows them to contribute to the world and realize their potential with the necessary assets and resources. And that becomes a magnet for people who want to join us because our platform is an exciting place to learn and grow.",
            "Also, there is a lot that we know we do not know. But one thing I discovered is that humility should ground the companyâs culture.",
            " What advice would you give a young professional just setting out in this field?",
            " When I started, I thought about it as a lifetime of learning. It is really important to be around people who are smart, hardworking, nice, patient, and who help us overcome our own gaps and shortcomings.",
            "I think the most important behaviors are the willingness to continue to ask questions, read the literature, study what people have already considered, and embrace being together, collaborating, and learning from each other.",
            " What has kept you excited during your tenure at II-VI and Coherent?",
            " When we recently completed a large acquisition, we changed up the values of the acquired company. I realized how important values are and that we are a little different. Our values are integrity, collaboration, accountability, respect, and enthusiasm. And taken together, in that order, they have allowed our employees to declare âI careâ as the primary reason for them to come to the company, stay with us, and help change the world.",

To give customers a compelling reason to purchase, products increasingly need performance improvements and features that require the integration of complex and novel technologies. More consumers also expect next-generation products to be more sustainable, creating new constraints around material and component selection, repairability, and end-of-life considerations. And the pressure to keep R&D costs low is as relentless as ever.",

            "A digital twin is a virtual replica of a systemâs behavior in its operating environment. That system, which might be a product, a manufacturing process, or even an entire supply chain, is represented by a collection of digital models. Those models process and react to various stimuli, which are data representing the external environment. Digital twins combine multiple types of models and process data from multiple sources. That allows them to offer a better approximation of a real object than traditional simulation approaches.",

The scope of an early digital twin might be a single, critical component, for example, expanding to a whole product as the companyâs level of digital-twin maturity increases. Similarly, early digital twins may be applied in just one area of the value chain, often engineering, while later twins may also simulate the product in manufacturing and use.",
            "In advanced industries, survey data indicate that almost 75 percent of companies have already adopted digital-twin technologies that have achieved at least medium levels of complexity. There is significant variance between sectors, however. Players in the automotiveâand aerospace and defenseâindustries appear to be more advanced in their use of digital twins today, while logistics, infrastructure, and energy players are more likely to be developing their first digital-twin concepts.",

            "In the United States, an automotive company is building a system that can model all the software and hardware configurations it offers. The system will be used to simulate the effect of design improvements before they are delivered to customers as over-the-air updates. And a US multinational industrial company is developing multiphysics models of turbines to enable real-time wear prediction, performance fine-tuning, and the optimization of output against service life and total cost of ownership.",
            "These companies and other digital-twin pioneers cite four main motivations for their investment in the technology.",
            "Our conversations with senior R&D leaders show that digital twins are already making a significant difference for product development performance. They have cut total development times by 20 to 50 percent for some users, reducing cost along the way. For others, they have reduced the number of expensive preproduction prototypes to be builtâoften from two or three to just one. Because so much testing, verification, and customer-acceptance work can be completed in a virtual environment, some companies report that products starting out as digital twins have 25 percent fewer quality issues when they enter production. They have a higher chance of succeeding commercially, too: one company reported 3 to 5 percent higher sales of digital-twin-based products, thanks to better features, higher quality, and improved customer satisfaction. Finally, a digital twin created during product development can allow companies to offer a range of value-added aftermarket services, including predictive maintenance and in-service performance optimization. That can increase revenues by 5 to 10 percent in some product categories.",
            "Integrating digital-twin technology into the early stages of product development could allow companies to adopt processes that work faster, deliver better results, and bring them closer to their customers. Take the design of complex, highly customized products such as machines for advanced manufacturing, for example. Such products are typically made as one-offs or in extremely small volumes, and each unit requires significant up-front engineering input. Using conventional engineering methods, the absence of prototypes means that these products often require significant work after delivery to iron out problems and optimize performance.",

            "A company with a robust digital-twin platform, by contrast, can conduct comprehensive full-product simulations in a virtual environment before any proposed design is signed off on by the customer. Since complex machines typically use a combination of existing and newly engineered elements, companies can keep a library of digital-twin models of key components, combining them with the models of new parts to create the full digital twin. That twin can be used to demonstrate the proposed solution to the customer and verify that the new design meets their needs. And the digital-twin models of the new components can then be added to the library, making them available for future projects with similar requirements.",
            "Building a digital-twin platform is tricky, however. Early adopters report challenges around integrating digital-twin technologies into their existing digital-product-development environment and wider IT infrastructure, for example. Digital twins also require new ways of working, both within R&D functions and beyond them. That means a successful digital-twin program is a change management effort, requiring senior management commitment and support, and a strong program management team to track milestones, develop new processes, and support their adoption by the organization.",
            "To overcome these potential roadblocks, companies can adopt a phased approach to digital-twin adoption. The first three phases address the technological challenges of platform selection, architecture design, and integration. Subsequent phases focus on the organizational transformation required to support new processes and working practices.",
            "These three phases will require staff with a range of specialized skills, including systems engineers for requirements definition and analysts for model development. At its peak, a digital-twin platform development team may involve about 50 people.",
            "To integrate digital-twin technology into the organization, companies can opt for one of three archetypes (exhibit). The digital-twin team could be structured as a separate business unit that is responsible for creating its own distinct portfolio of digital assets that are sold alongside the corresponding physical assets. Or the digital-twin team could be integrated into an existing business unit, with a focus on developing and supporting digital-twin applications associated with the products of that business. This approach can be a good way to gain experience with digital twins, or might be appropriate where limited synergies between business units mean there is little additional value to be gained by carving out the digital-twin team as a separate unit. Finally, the digital-twin team can operate as a separate center of excellence that supports the development of applications within existing business units. This approach helps companies scale their digital-twin efforts quickly while ensuring consistent processes and technology components.",
            "Digital twins are helping product companies capitalize on recent advances in the Internet of Things artificial intelligence. As these technologies continue their recent rapid progress, digital twins can be expected to evolve in parallel. It is feasible that digital twins will soon be able to proactively search for new insights, for example by altering the settings of sensors and acquisition hardware installed on products in the field. They will be able to use those data to refine their own models and generate new insights for manufacturers and users. Interaction between digital twins will enable the simulation of highly complex environments, such as port operations, city transport systems, or multistakeholder engineering supply chains. Eventually, we may see the emergence of digital twins capable of learning from their own experiences, identifying opportunities and offering product improvement suggestions entirely autonomously.",

            " They argued that the inherent inefficiencies of general-purpose compute architectures (for example, CPUs) will start to yield to (or be complemented by) the compute power and cost efficiency of architectures optimized for specific computational tasks, also called domain-specific architectures (DSAs) (exhibit).",
            "At the same time, as compute and digitization are proliferating into many application domains, such as cloud (AI and high-performance computing), networking, edge, the Internet of Things (IoT), and autonomous driving, highly domain-specific computational workloads are expanding the opportunities for DSAs to offer meaningful performance advantages. Large language models, a core engine for generative AI, through applications such as ChatGPT provide further specialization within AI workloads at very high volume and may lead to further hardware specialization.",
            "The commercial potential of DSAsâhardware and software developed for a specific application domainâis sizable. Already, graphics processing units (GPUs) and tensor processing units (TPUs) have gained significant market share in data centers, where they outperform CPUs for workloads that benefit from a high degree of parallelization, such as AI workloads (learning and inferencing). The performance improvements can be dramatic, with workload-specific accelerations of 15 to 50 times being common. In automotive, customized solutions from leading providers deliver the low-latency, high-performance inference needed to safely support increasing levels of autonomous driving.",

Therefore, it is not a surprise that we have seen a marked increase in venture capital inflows into domain-specific design start-ups, with $18 billion of funding supporting roughly 150 start-ups cumulatively in the past ten years, a stark difference with the decade prior, when hardware investments were shunned in favor of software.",
            "Firms in the semiconductor value chain, manufacturers of compute systems, and end users of compute solutions should prepare to take advantage of this trend rather than be caught off guard.",
            "Historically, in addition to benefiting from the massive tailwind of Mooreâs law, CPUs have benefited from large economies of scale to offset theoretical benefits from competing domain-specific chips, which logically face smaller volume demand due to their specificity and which may require specialty software to deploy efficiently. The more expensive the chip (driven by die size, complexity, and process technology node), the larger the scale required from the application domain to justify a DSA. Fueling the disruptive potential of DSAs are the following five important enablers that are coming together to narrow the economic gap between general-purpose and domain-specific designs:",
            "Foundriesâcompanies that focus on semiconductor manufacturing servicesâhave taken increasing share of global semiconductor manufacturing because they can aggregate demand and achieve the efficiencies of scale needed to offset the escalating cost of producing modern semiconductors. (The cost of a leading-edge semiconductor fabrication plant, or âfab,â is more than $10 billion.) Not only have foundries steadily gained manufacturing market share across technology nodes, but they also offer access to the most advanced technology nodes, an edge held until recently by integrated device manufacturers. As a result, any start-up with a clever idea for an outperforming DSA design can rapidly access the most advanced manufacturing to have it built without having to invest a single dollar in manufacturing capacity.",
            "Would-be providers of superior DSAs, specifically those targeting enterprise, AI, or high-performance computing (HPC) workloads, do not necessarily need to develop their own go-to-market infrastructure. They can rely on a mature ecosystem of cloud service providers (CSPs) that offer compute as a service. If they can demonstrate to CSPs and their customer base that their DSA offers superior compute performance (per dollar and per watt) for specific workloads, their hardware solutions can be integrated into the CSP data center infrastructure and be offered as a hardware instance to end customers of the compute cycles.",
            "Even though DSAs are, by definition, designed for domain-specific workloads, this does not mean DSA designers have to start from scratch when designing the circuitry. Licensable instruction set architectures (ISAs), such as Arm and x86, and open-source ISAs such as RISC-V democratize chip design and provide a rich set of building blocks and ready-to-go design components. They also permit access to the respective ecosystems of compilers and application-level software solutions. Choosing between these different ecosystems as a foundation will be a trade-off between software stack maturity, cost, and domain-specific hardware performance.",
            "Increasingly, leading-edge compute devices are no longer made up of a single chip. As high-performance chips have grown bigger and process technology has become more expensive and more difficult to deliver at high process yields, leading players have moved to a disaggregation strategy, building chiplets rather than a single large, monolithic die. These chiplets, potentially optimized on their own process technology and for their own functions, are subsequently integrated in an advanced package. Where chip packages used to contain only one chip, advanced packaging allows for the heterogeneous integration of tens of chips in a single package, arranged in 2-D and even in 3-D. This technology trend is favorable for firms focusing on DSA chiplets, since these chiplets can now be integrated in advanced packages, allowing for connectivity with other compute, communication, memory, and analog components with extremely high bandwidth and low latency.",
            "About $18 billion in venture capital funding has flowed in to fuel roughly 150 start-ups in the past decade, as identified in a McKinsey industry scan. This is a significant departure from the prior decade, when venture capital interest in semiconductor hardware start-ups was anemic. Notable use cases of domain-specific architectures (DSAs) can be found in five domains (exhibit).",
            " DSAs can accelerate AI training by up to 50 times thanks to parallel computing and the integration of high-bandwidth memory. Our research uncovered at least 95 start-ups currently working on DSAs for AI. Theyâve raised an aggregate of $10.6 billion to date.",
            " DSAs offer real-time processing with ultra-low latency to facilitate higher levels of autonomy. Our research uncovered relatively few DSA start-ups in this area; ten DSA start-ups focusing on autonomous vehicles have received $2.8 billion in funding to date.",
            " DSAs need to offer robustness, remote maintainability, and energy efficiency (for example, extremely low power consumption both in active and passive mode). We have identified nine start-ups focused on IoT applications of DSAs that have raised about $1 billion to date.",
            " DSAs boost performance even further. They offer high throughput efficiency, ultra-fast interconnections between compute nodes, and the memory capacity and latency required for these tasks. A conservative estimate puts the number of start-ups in this domain at 24, with $2.4 billion raised to date.",
            " DSAs can provide more energy- and cost-efficient solutions for specific mining protocols. With about $1 billion between them, at least 16 start-ups are working on DSA applications to blockchain.",
            "Alternatives to complementary metalâoxideâsemiconductors (CMOS) for the physical compute layer, such as photonics and neuromorphic and quantum architectures, promise to offer specific advantages for domain-specific compute needs, such as energy efficiency, plasticity, task-specific speed, and linear scaling with specific NP-hard problems (for more on DSA use cases, see sidebar, âDomain-specific architecture use cases, ready to goâ). As these physical-layer solutions mature, they will open up new classes of DSAs.",
            "Across the tech stack, from physical-layer to application-level workload management, further innovations are needed to propel the feasibility and commercial success of DSAs.",
            "At the physical and circuit layer, open-source ecosystems such as Arm and RISC-V need to mature further to support a full software stack on top of DSAs based on these building blocks. Without efficient software stacks, many hardware-level performance advantages will not translate into real-life workload accelerations.",
            "At the system-in-package (SiP) level, standardization of chiplet interfaces will be required to allow economic and ubiquitous integration of DSAs. Industry consortiums such as the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) have started to form to define these standards. Furthermore, in the United States, the CHIPS Act and DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) recognize that the realization of collaborative development platforms for advanced packaging is an important investment area and are directing incentives to stimulate their development.",
            "At the operating-system and compiler level, higher-level compilers will need to account efficiently for the potential coexistence of multiple ISAs in a single package.",
            "At the data center level, advanced hypervisors and orchestrators will be needed to coordinate workload containers optimally across different DSA compute instances and balance utilization across the data center to deliver the DSA-level benefits to the end customerâs applications. Furthermore, CSPs will develop tools to support their end customers to understand the optimal configuration of hardware instances for their specific compute needs to avoid inefficient deployment of compute resources.",
            "DSAs will likely activate disruptions throughout the semiconductor value chain. Hereâs how to prepare for them.",
            "Materials providers should understand the impact of advanced packaging (for example, the need for new substrate materials that form the foundation of 2-D and 3-D integration and the need to be thermally and mechanically more stable than current substrate materials), as well as the impact of new physical-layer paradigms on front-end and back-end material flows.",
            "Front-end tool manufacturers will want to participate in the advanced-packaging and heterogenous-integration boom supporting DSA integration, which will require precision definition and alignment similar to front-end manufacturing.",
            "Foundries will need to gear up to meet demand for smaller batches and a higher mix of domain-specific chips and chiplets and find ways to support smaller players efficiently and economically. In addition, support for nonâleading edge and new physical-layer solutions such as photonics will become ever more important as functionality is disaggregated into task-optimized chiplets.",
            "Chip design firms will require talent that can think through end-to-end domain-specific workload performance, from gate layout and hardware architectural design choices to software stacks and workload management, to take full advantage of DSAsâ architectural optimization.",
            "Electronic design automation (EDA) and hardware IP firms should respond to two challenges. The first is how to adapt their business models to support smaller DSA disrupters that may not have the financial firepower to buy expensive up-front licenses. The second is how to expand their IP, design, and simulation suites from chip level to SiP level to support system-level, multiphysics (logical, electrical, thermal, optical, and mechanical) EDA across multiple chiplets and ISAs working together at bandwidths and latencies previously seen only at chip level.",
            "CSPs have already recognized the value of workload-specific chip architectures, as demonstrated through their increasing adoption of GPUs, as well as by moving to in-house chip designs for data center hardware instances. As design start-ups continue to target workload specificity for AI and HPC use cases, CSPs will want to keep close tabs on emerging winners that they can potentially support and propel to scale.",
            "Enterprise customers need to educate themselves on the benefits of using DSAs for their specific workloads. The benefits of moving their compute infrastructure into public clouds will only increase because access to the DSAs can be offered at scale by CSPs that can aggregate demand for specialized hardware instances and efficiently manage the workload deployment to them. However, enterprises should gain or retain the expertise on how to best leverage these hardware instances, based on a deep understanding of how their specific workloads and cloud hardware instance configurations can be optimized to deliver maximum total cost of ownership benefits.",
            "Domain-specific OEMsâsuch as IoT and edge device makers, networking-equipment vendors, car manufacturers, and blockchain platformsâwill want to deeply understand the evolution of their domain-specific compute needs and workloads rather than relying on general-purpose compute progress. They will also want to familiarize themselves with the architectural options that exist to meet those needs in chip design that are optimized for their energy, cost, footprint, and performance needs. This may require them to reach beyond traditional supply chain structures: for example, automotive OEMs may need to directly scout for and engage with DSA start-ups rather than relying on tier-one and tier-two suppliers to have all the latest insights.",
            "Mooreâs law has propelled the compute industry with incredible longevity, driving decades of performance improvements in general-purpose computing that largely negated the need for investments in workload specialization. With transistor scaling slowing down, DSAs will increasingly gain a use-case-specific performance edge and drive significant disruptions for value chain participants and their customers.",

There is also considerable growth in EV battery volumes as they approach end-of-life, with over 100 million vehicle batteries expected to be retired in the next decade.",
            " Moving from fossil-fuel based to electric mobility is a clear positive for the environment and for many consumersâ pocketbooks, but overhauling our transportation system requires new supply chains to be designed and scaled. With this challenge comes an opportunityâto scale a supply chain that is more stable, more resilient, more efficient, and more sustainable than that of the fossil-fuel and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle industry. Battery recycling is the key to pursuing that opportunity (see sidebar, âBatteriesâ second lives: An additional revenue streamâ).",

            "In China, Europe, and the United States, which are all undergoing a large EV transition, most of the battery material suitable for recycling still comes from consumer electronics cells, such as those in laptops and other household items, and cell manufacturing scrap generated from faulty batteries that donât pass quality control. With cell manufacturing scrap being as high as 30 percent when a new battery factory launches, a significant source of volume for recycling evolves in markets where EV battery manufacturing is kicking into high gear. In markets where EV adoption has been pervasive for some time, such as China, end-of-life EV batteries represent a greater volume. Yet, globally, production scrap will likely remain the primary source of battery materials for recycling until 2030, when end-of-life EV battery volumes will have grown to the point of overtaking (Exhibit 1).",
            "Unlike consumer electronics batteries, which are too small to integrate into second-life systems, and cell production scrap, which cannot be used in batteries, end-of-life EV batteries can be profitably remanufactured and used again in other applications. This can create an additional revenue stream for battery owners before those batteries are recycled.

Batteries that are suitable for these second-life applications may well take this detour on their way to being recycled but, when taking a value-maximizing approach, all EV batteries should eventually find their way into recycling processes.",

            "There are two battery recycling technology pathways that are most commonly used, and further innovative recycling methods that are undergoing research and development.",
            "Once end-of-life batteries have been collected and received at the recycling facilities, they are initially tested, discharged, and disassembled (Exhibit 3). At this point, disassembled batteries go through a process called âshredding.â This typically consists of a thermal treatment of batteries before or after crushing to remove impurities such as the organic fraction (for example, plastic), optimize the separation of electrode active material and current collector foil, and change the phase of valuable metal to a reduced form for optimized efficiency in hydrometallurgical processing. After various screening and sorting steps leveraging physical properties of battery components such as size, shape, magnetism, density, and conductivity, the process yields multiple material fractions, which includes âblack mass,â a powder containing valuable material such as nickel, cobalt, lithium, and graphite. Alternatively, mechanical pre-treatment can be performed without the use of heat, usually yielding a more complex black mass composition with more impurities.",
            "Once the black mass is generated, one of the two following processing methods is typically used:",
            " The screened black mass is extensively treated with acids where the metals are dissolved. A series of so-called âsolvent extraction,â âcrystallization,â and âprecipitationâ steps separates the different metal ions, which can then be used to produce battery-ready materials such as nickel sulfate or lithium carbonate. Thermally treated black mass is the preferred feedstock for this process, mainly due to the absence of organics (such as solvents, binders). Mechanical pretreatment combined with hydrometallurgical processing presents a complex, though viable process, which requires more reagents to achieve high material recovery rates and battery-grade quality products.",
            " Pyrometallurgical recycling can use black mass as a feedstock but, unlike hydrometallurgical processing, doesnât necessarily require it. Usually, batteries are directly smelted in a furnace to recover cobalt, nickel, and copper, in the form of an alloy, while other components mostly end up as slag (such as lithium, aluminum, and silicon). Subsequently, the produced alloy is further processed in a comparatively simpler hydrometallurgical refining method to extract the raw materials and produce battery metal salts ready for battery-precursor production. Pyrometallurgical processing typically can be operated as a robust process with very high nickel, cobalt, and copper recovery rates, yet it yields lower total material recoveries compared to mechanical pretreatment in combination with hydrometallurgical processing, as many materials are burned or lost in the slag. Further, the process requires sophisticated gas cleaning systems.",
            " Various recycling methods, such as direct recycling or hydro-to-cathode-active-material recycling, are currently in the research, development, and commercialization stages. These new recycling pathways aim to increase material recovery rates, decrease energy and reagent consumption, and decrease emissions and wastewater. For example, research projects in Europe and the United States both propose froth flotation, a metal concentration method typically used in the mining industry, as an effective method to recover graphite that is currently burned or sent to landfill during or after the recycling process. Recovering graphite, a component that represents around 15 to 25 percent of a batteryâs weight, may become a requirement under the recently proposed EU regulation that mandates a 65 percent and 70 percent material recovery by 2025 and 2030, respectively.",
            "Across the battery recycling value chain, from collection to metal recovery, revenues are expected to grow to more than $95 billion a year by 2040 globally,",
            " predominantly driven by the price of the recovered metals, expected battery cell chemistry adoption, regionalization of supply chains, etcetera.  The monetary value generated per ton of battery material could approach approximately $600 by as early as 2025 (Exhibit 4). Going forward, we expect the value creation potential to grow to similar levels to the primary metals industry, which is around 30 percent depending on price developments.",
            "Battery recycling revenues are driven by",
            " the sales of recovered raw materials, which typically are composed of the raw materials price times the mass content per battery times the recovery rate for each metal in the battery. Today, automotive OEMs pay disposal companies to take scrap or end-of-life batteries, and ownership of the battery is entirely transferred. In the future, battery recyclers will likely shift to a tolling model in which the recycler charges a fee for the service of recycling the battery while the OEM maintains control over the recovered raw materials. Alternatively, automotive OEMs may sell their battery scrap and spent batteries to recyclers for whom the value of raw materials in those batteries is above the recycling cost plus margin.",
            "In addition to the cost to procure the batteries to be recycledâthe âfeedstockââthere are more costs and associated operating decisions that can have significant impact on a recyclerâs profitability:",
            "A whole reverse supply chain will need to be set up to collect, test, and recycle batteries. And companies are pursuing a variety of business models to facilitate that.",
            "Different business models exist within the battery recycling space. These range from companies covering individual value-chain steps (for example, shredding) to integrated companies covering all value-chain steps from end-of-life battery reverse logistics to battery material refining. Over the past few years, there has been a trend of consolidation and integration, as automotive OEMs become increasingly interested in end-to-end recycling offerings, instead of managing different players across the value chain themselves. Integrated companies can be characterized into three archetypes depending on the level of organizational integration:",
            "While the battery recycling market is growing fast, itâs still far from maturity, and market leadership is not yet consolidated. The European market alone has seen over 40 battery recycling related announcements. A similar pattern is emerging in the United States. Even in China, where the recycling market is more mature due to the larger availability of end-of-life batteries and production scrap, top players only control up to 15 percent of the market. We have identified three key levers that battery recyclers could adopt to keep or gain an edge in the battery-recycling market.",
            ": Battery recyclers need to secure large-enough volume to generate meaningful short-term scale with the potential for growth in the longer term. This can take the form of contracts with battery-cell producers for production scrap, as well as contracts with automotive OEMs for future volumes of end-of-life battery packs.",
            ": Battery recyclers that are not already vertically integrated could explore building cross-value-chain ecosystems so that they are able to offer more attractive, end-to-end solutions to automotive OEMs.",
            " OEMs are making their recycling selection based on demonstrated material recovery rates, product quality, and process efficiency, therefore investing in the technological pathways that can provide superior performance will be essential. That said, EV batteries are far from the point of standardization, so technology investments should be calibrated by close engagement with the R&D teams of the OEMs with which the recycler is collaborating or looking to collaborate. Exchanging information about planned changes to battery chemistry and pack design that OEMs may be considering, and about the resource intensity of the various steps of the recycling process, for instance, could pave the way for technical and design decisions that make it simpler, and even more profitable, for batteries to be recycled. â",
            "â requires effort to coordinate across the value chain and develop a refined understanding of processes outside of the recyclerâs direct scope, but can strengthen partnerships and supply chains significantly.",
            "Without recycling, battery materials are expected to remain a critical bottleneck for electrification. As such, the growth and the profitability of the EV battery recycling sector has the potential to make or break the pace of the vital transition from an internal-combustion world to an electric one.",
            "Thankfully, the potential value creation for EV battery recycling, at $95 billion per year by 2040, is massive and is attracting attention from automotive OEMs, battery OEMs, and investors. While we expect a great deal of movement to continue in the space, developing at-scale offtake agreements, partnering and investing to fill gaps in the value chain, and collaborating with feedstock suppliers to drive efficiency in technology and design will set industry leaders apart. Whatâs clear for now is that for the automotive sector, the path to scaling the EV supply chain may not be a straight one, but a circular one.",

The regionâs combination of forward-thinking incumbent manufacturers and early-adopting EV consumers offers it a unique opportunity to create a world-leading EV ecosystem. That could generate new jobs, lessen air pollution, accelerate progress toward climate goals, and help Europe become a global EV lighthouse.",
            "Yet a larger uptake of EVs will require a major build-out of Europeâs EV-charging infrastructure. In 2021, the continent had an estimated 375,000 charging stations. But a recent analysis by McKinsey (see sidebar, âThe EV Charging Infrastructure Masterplanâ), conducted for a report from the European Automobile Manufacturersâ Association (ACEA), suggests thatâin even the most conservative scenarioâthe EU-27 will need at least 3.4 million operational public charging points by 2030.",
            " Extensive utility grid upgrades will be required to distribute electricity to these new charging stations and for the increased renewable-energy capacity Europeâs future EVs will need to run on cleaner power (Exhibit 1). In all, this build-out of the EV-charging infrastructure may cumulatively cost upward of â¬240 billion by 2030.",
            "These findings hold important implications for a variety of stakeholders. Charging-equipment manufacturers will probably need to scale up production. Charge-point operators might wish to coordinate with electric utilities to address the predicted power demands. And automobile and truck makers must prepare to meet shifting consumer priorities.",
            "The potential social inequities that could result from the infrastructure rollout are an important issue. Fortunately, the supply of infrastructure can be designed for inclusiveness through careful coordination and investment. Below are some key findings noted in the ACEA report and our analysis of what they could mean for ",
            ".",
            "Prospective EV buyers want assurances that theyâll be able to charge their vehicles conveniently, but each additional EV driver creates more competition for access to public charging points. A 2019 McKinsey survey found that more than half of consumersâ concerns about EVs involved batteries, charging, and driving range. Without enough charging stations to allay driversâ anxieties, the adoption of EVs could slow.",
            "Two potential scenarios could emerge: one in which an abundance of installed charging points helps drive EV demand and another in which charging points are installed in line with current utilization growth rates. Even in the latter, less aggressive scenario, by 2030 the EU-27 would need to scale up from its current 340,000 charging stations to the estimated 3.4 million public chargers required to meet the needs of its future EV fleet. (That figure includes 2.9 million public chargers for passenger cars, 0.4 million for light commercial vehicles, and 0.1 million for trucks and buses. It does not include the estimated 29 million private charging stations that homeowners, apartment building managers, and workplace parking operators would have to install.) This more conservative scenario would require an acceleration from about 1,600 installations of public charging points a week in 2021 to more than 10,000 a week in 2030 (Exhibit 2).",
            "Last year, France (where about 400 public chargers a week are now installed) and Germany (with about 200) had the fastest pace of installation in the European Union. But they, and the entire European Union, are far behind the target rate, which would ramp up with each new year. On average, 6,000 public charging points a week would have to be installed in the European Union as a whole from 2021 to 2030, so there is much ground to make up.",
            "Parts of Europeâs electricity grid will need to be reinforced before millions of new EV chargers can be connected to it. But the grid upgrades directly required by the electricity demands of new EV infrastructure would account for only 11 percent of total annual EU-27 grid investments. Most grid enhancements will be directed at distribution systems, carrying medium- and low-voltage electricity from substations to end users, not at centralized, high-voltage transmission systems.",
            "Two potential use cases will benefit from heightened attention:",
            "The widespread adoption of EVs could help Europe achieve its decarbonization targetsâunless fossil fuels generate the energy used to charge EVs. To prevent EVs from triggering an increase in Europeâs carbon emissions, the report calls for adding sufficient renewable-energy capacity to meet the additional electricity demand expected from future EVs.",
            "Our analysis shows that electricity demand resulting directly from the charging of passenger and commercial EVs could increase from nine terawatt hours (less than 1 percent of the regionâs current total electricity consumption) in 2021 to 165 terawatt hours in 2030. As a result, though EV-specific electricity demand may increase by nearly 40 percent a year, it may still represent only about 6 percent of all electricity consumed in the EU-27 (Exhibit 3).",
            "The push to electrify Europeâs vehicles will be profoundly more difficult if EV ownership remains out of reach for a large share of Europeâs population. But making EVs a realistic choice for everyone doesnât mean just making the vehicles affordable. It also means providing access to affordable charging points.",

            "Buyers who live in single-family houses with garages might have little problem installing their own chargers. For everyone else, charging will be less straightforward. EV owners who live in apartment buildings and park on the street will rely heavily on public chargersâin 2021, 42 percent of European EV owners living in cities had no access to home charging points. They might well fear that competition for access to those public chargers will be fierce. An equitable rollout of charging infrastructure calls for installing public charging points in all neighborhoods.",
            "The broader challenge is that public charging today is 30 to 200 percent more expensive than private charging. Ensuring a fair charging price for EV owners who donât have access to private charging points at home or at work will be extremely important in the transition to an all-electric Europe.",
            "The infrastructure rollout that the report envisions would cost a cumulative total of â¬240 billion for hardware and installation by 2030. That includes installing new charging points, upgrading power grids, and increasing renewable-energy generation capacity. More than half of this fundingâ60 percent, or â¬130 billionâwould support the planning, engineering, and installation of new public and private charging points (20 and 40 percent of the total, respectively). Fifteen percent would pay for grid upgrades and 25 percent for renewable-energy capabilities.",
            "Homeowners will need to pay for the hardware and installation of their private charging points, possibly receiving government subsidies to offset costs. Public charging points will be built either by private charging operators (who will look to make money from their investments) or by local public utilities. Costs for grid upgrades will ultimately translate into electricity distribution fees for end consumers. Utilities will build and finance new renewable-energy capacity.",
            "There are two potential infrastructure development pathways, which could affect stakeholders in different ways:",
            "This is just one possible area of variance in outcomes as this large infrastructure project progresses. Stakeholders will need to consider a range of eventualities while scanning the horizon. Below, we describe the potential implications of a charging-infrastructure rollout. Our account is geared toward the perspectives of different interests.",
            "The demand-driven pathway, with its larger number of chargers, assumes lower utilization rates for each individual charger. This would almost certainly reduce the profitability of charging-point operators (CPOs). The utilization-oriented pathway, by contrast, ensures that most charging points will be profitable. CPOs are likely to prefer the utilization-oriented pathway to avoid âstrandedâ (unprofitable) charging stations.",
            "In many cases, grid operators have no visibility into charging behavior, so it is difficult to anticipate and manage electricity demand. Smart charging, involving communication between EVs and electricity distribution systems, could enable active load management by shifting electricity flows from EV charging to times of day when general demand is lower. This might mitigate the need for investments in grid infrastructure by reducing strain, as well as electricity costs for consumers.",
            "Smart chargingâs potential is especially high in places where vehicles are parked and connected to chargers for prolonged periodsâfor instance, charging at home, at a workplace, or at a fleet depot for commercial vehicles. A first development phase, which could be widely under way by 2030, would involve unidirectional smart charging: the charging times of EVs would be centrally controlled to reduce peak loads. In a second stage, bidirectional smart charging would use vehicle batteries as intermittent storage within the grid: batteries could be charged or discharged depending on levels of energy generation and demand.",
            "Bidirectional charging is a particularly promising way to store energy on the grid, since the European Unionâs passenger EVs would have up to three terawatt-hours of available battery capacityâequivalent to 40 percent of the European Unionâs daily average energy demand. The technology would be a timely solution because the need for grid storage is expected to rise during the transition to renewable energy. To be implemented, bidirectional charging would require grid operators to partner with EV owners, and that would create new business models to compensate them for depleting their batteries.",
            "The more chargers that are created, the more immediate the benefit for auto manufacturers. A potential EV buyer will be more likely to go electric if public chargers are available in convenient locations. The build-out could be accelerated by collaborations among manufacturers, such as the IONITY charging network (a joint venture by BMW, Daimler, Ford, Hyundai, and Volkswagen).",
            "Alternatively, if auto manufacturers and automotive suppliers can create a vehicle capable of charging more quickly than it can today, they could reduce the number of public chargers needed. Faster vehicle charging speeds will both reduce range anxiety in drivers and allow a more efficient charging point build-out (since fewer chargers are required to charge the same amount of vehicles).",
            "If auto manufacturers and automotive suppliers can create vehicles capable of charging more quickly than todayâs can, they could reduce the number of public chargers needed.",
            "The city of Stockholm is a pacesetter for infrastructure deployment: the average end-to-end installation time for a direct-current (DC) fast charger (150 kilowatts or higher) is seven months. Similar installations in other locations can take up to 20 months. Stockholmâs preparation-heavy approach requires an up-front investment of time because cities and municipalities must conduct high-level feasibility screenings in collaboration with operators of electricity distribution networks. Once a promising charging location is identified, approval processes move quicklyâwhich in turn accelerates the planning undertaken by charging-point operators.",
            "Other locales have discovered different (and potentially complementary) approaches. The city of Oslo has devised a checklist to speed up project approvals. The Netherlands created a knowledge platform to address concerns quickly. Franceâs âright to a socketâ policy eliminates the back-and-forth required for home installation approvals.",
            "Governments now direct their EV-funding budgets largely to incentives for purchasing EVs. It could be beneficial to examine how much is spent to subsidize EV infrastructure and renewable-energy generation. A balance will need to be found between encouraging private-sector funding for charging infrastructure while also using public support to ensure an equitable build-out, so that affordable charging is available even in less profitable locations.",
            "Europe, which is undergoing a once-in-a-century mobility revolution, can embrace this opportunity. Success will require the building out of the EV-charging infrastructure, clearly communicated strategies, and strong cooperation among a wide variety of public and private stakeholders."

They also want to integrate digital services into an automotive ecosystem that goes far beyond the conventional car to a smartphone-like experience.",
            "Moving from a conventional car to an automotive ecosystemâa kind of smartphone on wheelsârequires changes to the vehicleâs electronics and software architecture. That means shifting from the traditional use of scattered, embedded electronic-control units (ECUs) to a domain-focused system with central vehicle controllers.",
            " It requires more sophisticated software, including a software abstraction layer, Ethernet usage, and connectivity at scale. It also means greater use of more sophisticated microprocessors instead of embedded microcontrollers to boost performance, reduce power consumption, and centralize control.",
            "Consequently, OEMs and suppliers need to shift their R&D processes and operating models from hardware engineering to a combination of software and tech-driven systems engineering. In this new environment, routine upgrades will happen throughout the vehicleâs life cycle, including over-the-air (OTA) updates to fix bugs, update software features, improve customer experiences, or sell new features not available at the time of the vehicleâs original sale. This requires that OEMs and suppliers shift their current development processes toward a cyclical, more integrated pattern and establish R&D steering approaches that connect software and hardware development along the entire life cycle of the vehicle.",
            "The shift toward electrification due to market and regulatory forces has resulted in new requirements across all main vehicle domains, including new electric powertrains; thermal management and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; and new infotainment services keyed to finding charging stations. Other new regulations related to cybersecurity, systems to manage software updates, and the use of Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Level 3 autonomous-driving capabilities could also make future vehicle performance parameters more complex.",
            "These challenges require automotive manufacturers and suppliers to shift their focus in product development capabilities, processes, and operating models from mechanical engineering toward electrical and electronics, software, and data engineering.",
            "Furthermore, the centers of gravity in global and regional markets continue to shift toward Asia, requiring local strategies to provide incentives for OEMs and suppliers to maintain local footprints and keep data in the region.

Likewise, the lack of clarity regarding key trends such as whether battery electric vehicles (BEVs) or fuel cells will become the dominant battery and energy solution could lead to increased R&D cost pressures. Expanding product complexity in the form of more control units, more software, and complex distribution functionality makes it difficult to attain high product maturity levels across product development processes.",
            "As shown in Exhibit 1, OEMs and suppliers need to manage several game changers and shift their mindset to be competitive in future automotive-product development:",
            "Automotive manufacturers and suppliers are moving from a strong hardware focus to a functional one, and many are changing their operating models to a systems-based development approach. This requires the introduction of a holistic systems-engineering approach combined with an agile organization and agile ways of working.",
            "Systems engineering is about breaking large, complex projects down into smaller, more manageable pieces and orchestrating the interfaces between them. It provides standardized processes for the product development process.",
            "A suitable reference system architecture is the key to successful systems engineering. Creating a logical and physical architecture that combines functional and physical elements typically starts with a functional system view based on system requirements. The goal is to design a modular product architecture to ensure that different teams can develop modules independently from each other in an agile way. This approach requires a top-down definition of general requirements with a strong focus on customer expectations and experience. The team then structures and breaks down the requirements along the reference system architecture. This approach features strengthened end-to-end responsibilities through clearly defined system-engineering roles and aligns the organizational structure with the system architecture to integrate the functional, logical, and physical architectures. The collaboration between OEMs and suppliers requires well-defined interfaces, using the logical or physical system breakdown as the guiding structure. Typically, this results in higher-level, more integrated ways of working in the collaboration between suppliers and OEMs.",
            "Automotive manufacturers and suppliers often combine overarching, classic engineering methods with agile development. Modern, complex product development uses improved top-down planning in sync with a bottom-up agile planning and development approach. Companies can use waterfall practices to define the overall vehicle and domain architecture. This in turn will allow them to provide agile teams with high-level inputs and boundary conditions. Based on these inputs, agile teams can create detailed requirements before developing and testing the components.",
            "There are three keys to making agile product development work: structure, process, and people.",
            " OEMs and suppliers create a network of cross-functional, empowered teams. The approach anchors the responsibilities for prioritization, architecture, road maps, and commonality on each system level, driven by strong decision making in the project organization. The delivery organization links closely to systems engineering, reflecting the system architecture featured along the different system levels. Likewise, the line organization reflects competencies and module ownership to optimally support the delivery organization and safeguard component and system communality. The structure of line organization must build on defined ways of working in things such as team structure, roles, and processes, and delivery teams should be stable across different projects.",
            " The goal of agile product development is to create rapid decision and learning cycles, which requires organizations to put supporting processes in place and align them throughout the entire organization. Likewise, the approach applies iterative and incremental development processes to hardware and mechatronics development, synchronizing them with top-down planning.",
            " Agile product development relies on a dynamic model that ignites passion in people. The mindset change to the agile model becomes core to the entire organization and all communications. This requires clear career paths within the agile context, built around new roles and moving away from the conventional hierarchical career paths. Training at scale includes change management to support the overall transformation.",
            "Software will be a key driver of customer experience and generate new revenue streams. Todayâs market research shows customers want more than a traditional car ownership experience. For example, four out of five customers would repurchase their current ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) solution, and more than two-thirds of premium consumers would switch brands for better ADAS functionalities. More than 40 percent of consumers also say they will use connectivity services more in the future, and about the same number are willing to pay for connected services.",
            "To seize this opportunity, OEMs need to switch from purchasing ECUs with embedded software to a more centralized electrical and electronics architecture and hardwareâsoftware separation (Exhibit 2). This enables the reuse of software and individual purchasing of hardware and software, as well as the integration of OEM-developed software modules. Tier-one suppliers should prepare for software-defined vehicles by building up software capabilities, developing new business models for software, and creating new collaboration models with suppliersâfor example, working in joint agile teams. The transformation will need to happen along three dimensions: technology, commercial structure, and commercial change.",
            " Technology will see a consolidation toward domain-centered archetypes (fourth-generation architectures) and zone- or vehicle-centered archetypes (fifth-generation architectures). This shift focuses on standardization by using IT components and systems via horizontally interlinked technical stacks instead of relying on integrated, embedded systems. Regional regulations and the cybersecurity ecosystem will in part enable this change. This means that OEMs must move from distributed architectures with ECUs for each specific functionality to a centralized architecture with the domain and vehicle computer abstracting hardware from software and the use of standardized interfaces.",
            " The industry structure will change significantly when OEMs start sourcing hardware and software separatelyâfor example, new players could enter the hardware and software space, or OEMs could work directly with tech players or tier-two specialists. To be successful, players must resolve new technical and commercial challenges at speed as new business models and specialist players in hardware and software introduce established, nonautomotive products to the market. OEMs must transition from working with several suppliers to creating alliances and partnerships centered on key technological control points, while tier-one suppliers must adapt to software sales and develop solutions in partnership with OEMs.",
            " Introducing the next generation of automotive electrical and electronics architecture requires a comprehensive business case that looks beyond the vehicle start of production (SOP) and initial bill of materials. Next-generation electrical and electronics architectures will require significant upfront investments that will pay off only in the following generation. The acquisition, development, and retention of new software and system-engineering talent and capabilities will be core to success. This success will shift the business model away from one-time sales and toward vehicle life cycle revenue streams and new forms of monetization, such as pay-per-use or subscription-based models.",
            "Automotive manufacturers are moving away from a traditional product development steering approach focused on direct material cost optimization targeting the SOP. Instead, companies are now exploring a holistic product development approach that optimizes the total cost of ownership (TCO) or the product business case over the entire vehicle life cycle, including sustainability-related costs.",
            "Automotive manufacturers are moving away from a traditional product development steering approach focused on direct material cost optimization targeting the SOP.",
            "Traditionally, OEMs and suppliers steer their product development activities without the support of a âsingle source of truth.â Instead, they rely on scattered data lakes and data systems for the most important product and cost data, including product specifications and features, material costs, R&D costs, capital expenditures, and other data. Typically, little data consistency exists across systems, and stakeholders base their planning and steering on different versions of data.",
            "OEMs focus on material cost optimization to reduce product costs and improve product profit. Other important key performance indicators and business case dimensions include R&D costs, capital expenditures, variants-based complexity costs (for example, testing and validation and integration of life cycle maintenance), and sustainability costs (including CO",
            " penalties). OEMs typically do not consider other items, such as revenues and costs for product or feature updates, in their R&D steering approaches. Consequently, such steering is currently not based on a TCO perspective and a holistic business case. Furthermore, the strong focus on material costs can lead to a high number of variants in the product portfolio configuration.",
            "Many OEMs employ a static financial steering approach that focuses on the SOP of a vehicle and does not consider dynamic or cyclical effects along the product development process. Thus, they systematically underestimate the effort and cost required today versus future revenues or costs over the vehicleâs life cycle. Furthermore, future revenues and costs are planned, targeted, and tracked in the same way as development efforts and product costs that happen before the SOP due to a lack of experience with update and release cycles for software, for example, and the underlying life cycle revenues and costs.",
            "OEMs must transform their approach to product development steering to focus on cost and revenue optimization over the entire vehicle life cycle as shown in Exhibit 3. They should implement ",
            "Â on a single source of truth. This approach features a harmonized systems landscape and a single end-to-end data backbone along the entire process of product development and life cycle management that connects all relevant steering KPIs. The systems landscape and data backbone must feature a common product structure that enables end-to-end steering from a systems perspective for team leads and department leads, all managed by the R&D controlling staff.",
            " The product development team should derive targets by benchmarking development projectsâand the benchmarks should reflect the true project intent. The team should set targets for all core steering dimensions, especially material costs, R&D costs, and capital expenditures, centered on benchmark-based target costing.",
            "OEMs have an opportunity to redefine their performance regarding R&D hardware and software costs. First, they need to set the right ambition level to drive innovation at a competitive cost level and identify opportunities for efficiency improvements to free up resources for other projects and innovations. They should optimize project assumptions (including levels of reuse, which technical concepts to use, and the amount of outsourcing) to prioritize R&D resources for the most important projects. OEMs also need to provide a fact base to support the planning and steering of their own R&D activities as well as negotiations and steering of suppliers and engineering service companies.",
            "OEM can typically use commercial databases to support their benchmarking efforts on material costs and capital expenditures; for R&D hardware and software costs, third-party providers can help. Companies should base their product development steering efforts on holistic business case optimization. The core of the steering approach should be the total product business case based on the TCO, including any costs that arise during the initial product development phase (for example, R&D costs, capital expenditures, and product and factory or production costs). It should also include all revenues and costs generated over the product life cycle, which can include product maintenance, releases and product updates for hardware and software, function-on-demand offers, and sustainability costs such as CO",

            "Companies should base their product development steering efforts on holistic business case optimization.",
            "Players shift the steering scope from SOP to life cycle management to enable âdesign for upgradabilityâ and to enhance the lifetime of the product. Product development steering should fully use the potential of OTA capabilities deployed in vehicles to offer feature updates, function-on-demand offerings, and new features such as higher levels of autonomous driving. It is important to note, however, that while this strategy will generate additional revenues, it will also create additional costs.",
            "Traditional product-focused R&D and product development processes typically remain in their lanes and have few structured interactions with other functions such as marketing and sales. Direct customer interactions or feedback remain rare and limit the voice of the customer in important product decisions.",
            "Instead, OEMs need to become more customer centered across the entire product development process, even to the point of launching a dedicated customer experience (CX) unit. The goal is to achieve customer-centered product development with integrated feedback from customers in short iteration cycles, where the voice of the customer sets the pace for the product development process. The OEM needs to ensure that all required information is shared with the suppliers, allowing them to significantly increase their customer centricity. In this approach, the OEMâs CX team is involved in the entire R&D process, from the initiation of the project to SOP and life cycle management.",
            "Before development starts, the team examines CX insights and conducts mid- to long-term planning as it collects business and industry trends and user feedback.",
            "During development, the team focuses on realizing a CX-driven unique selling point design. The CX team discusses the feasibility of CX elements with R&D, creates product and requirement documents, and participates in all aspects of development. It also influences requirement changes and cocreates the vehicle with technical R&D teams to ensure the product accurately reflects CX elements. Weekly progress reports enable managers to track progress between CX and R&D teams and their alignment on requirement changes.",
            "After SOP, the team drives CX upgrade opportunities and product life cycle management. It collects and aggregates user feedback, supports the R&D department in analyzing feedback, and disseminates conclusions to the relevant development teams.",
            "Becoming customer centered also requires a new go-to-market model that features direct interactions between the OEM and the end customer. Such direct sales will give the automaker full control over the customer experience, whereas a traditional overreliance on franchised dealers could lead to inconsistent customer handling. Beyond participation in the vehicleâs initial sale, OEMs need to cultivate a true life cycle experience with multiple car and noncar touchpoints per month. Where in the past automakers had to contend with patchy customer relationship management (CRM) data and limited sales lead analytics, this new approach provides full access and the full use of customer data through advanced analytics.",
            "Automotive OEMs are undergoing an essential transformation from experience-based engineering toward data-driven, virtual engineering. This development is strongly integrated and will affect automotive suppliers in the same way. The goal is to improve the product by developing new features (such as SAE Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous-driving capabilities) and increase R&D efficiency.",
            "Traditionally, OEMs incorporated engineering capabilities based on the collective experience of their engineers and experts with only limited data on customer behavior and product performance in the field. They made limited use of testing fleets or static hardware-in-the-loop or software-in-the-loop testing environments.",
            "Going forward, OEMs need to adopt data-enabled engineering and virtual-engineering capabilities to understand the value drivers of automotive customers in todayâs new ecosystem, which includes autonomous driving and data services. Automakers should also increase their engineering efficiency and use their limited R&D resources most efficiently. The adoption of these capabilities will also be pushed toward suppliers.",
            "Two product-related use cases illustrate potential changes in this area. The first use case takes advantage of advanced simulation techniques to improve multiphysics simulations via surrogate models or virtual testing with an AI-based driver in the loop. The second use case involves data-driven development based on a state-of-the-art big-data architecture. This architecture consists of a big-data stack in the backend, broad OTA capabilities, and a protected mode in the vehicle stack for in-vehicle simulations. Itâs paired with algorithms based on machine learning to intelligently collect data at scale and identify âinteresting situationsâ to propel the development of Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous-driving features or optimize driver-assistance features. It represents a critical enabler and precondition for leaping into Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous driving.",
            "Beyond product-related improvements, this transformation should propel productivity and efficiency advances due to predictive maintenance or defect detection enhancements. Likewise, proactive risk and error detection actions will improve overall productivity based on predictive maintenance and machine learning algorithms, as will intelligent talent and team management techniques such as capacity management and scheduling.",
            "Implementing big-data infrastructure and architecture is an essential requirement for driving data-enabled engineering and virtualization. Elements of these include the data backbone; the backend or big-data stack; in-vehicle architecture; technology such as machine learning algorithms and simulation techniques; and governance, including data governance, legal framework, and consent management processes.",
            "Automotive OEMs and suppliers need to adapt quickly to maintain their R&D competitiveness in areas including time to market, cost, quality, and new-feature rollouts. The first step should be a thorough and rapid assessment through benchmarking, diagnosing, and pursuing development. To benchmark R&D performance, they should compare their performance against peers on dimensions such as R&D intensity, new-product costs, time to market, and R&D offshore ratios. OEMs should also conduct an opportunity diagnostic, which involves making a quantitative assessment of R&D productivity based on historical programs and developing a digital workspace for continuous program review. Finally, OEMs and suppliers should pursue software and hardware development target costing, including for the needed resources and associated costs.",

            " Medtech performance was nearly double that of the S&P 500 in the 2012â19 period, but investor skepticism has since returned, and performance has slowed. Medtech companies (and the industry as a whole) will need to reinvent themselves across multiple dimensions to create the next wave of value for patients and shareholders over the next decade.",
            " R&D excellence is foundational for business growth in medtech. Accordingly, the industry invests substantially in innovation relative to other industries. R&D excellenceâits effectiveness, efficiency, and ROIâis a top priority for medtech leaders, but it is not achieved through spending alone. Medtech leaders excel at developing and managing an R&D portfolio, which serves as a compelling road map to growth and commercial performance. Their organizations have leading capabilities in product management, design thinking, and systems engineering. Medtech leaders have adopted agile development practices and next-generation digital and analytical tools, which increase their speed and effectiveness. And they engage with external sources of innovation.",
            " Software can be an important driver of growth for many medtechs, but it will require them to substantially shift their approaches to product development and make their operating models function like software companies. They can approach this transformation by pulling three levers. First, they can build a robust tech stack including engagement, intelligence, and infrastructure layers. Second, they can adopt software development best practices, including rethinking their approach to product management and tackling the conundrum of regulated software compliance. Third, they can strategically source intellectual property and talent.",
            " Digital health ecosystems, with participants from across the healthcare value chain, have advanced in recent years. These ecosystems have been enabled by improved access to health data (such as through improved electronic-health-record data interoperability and advances in cloud computing, AI, and machine learning), a shift in customer engagement preferences, and an increase in funding in healthcare technology. Medtech companies could expand their role in digital healthcare ecosystems by using their devices and data assets to improve care outcomes.",
            " Medtech leaders could transform their commercial models by first building a solid set of foundational capabilities to boost resilience and   identify their most strategic customers and highest-potential opportunities. Second, they could create a truly omnichannel customer experience and personalize engagement. Last, medtech leaders could harness the power of ecosystem selling as a force multiplier in a digital-first future.",
            " As companies grow bigger and devices become more complex, operations will be a differentiating factor for medtech leaders. Medtech companies can improve their operations to become more reliable, robust, and profitable, ultimately delivering better patient care. They can pursue targeted initiatives to rebuild supply chains with resilience as a priority and capture the full value of digitalization and Industry 4.0. They can drive innovation with a design-to-value approach and redesign their manufacturing and distribution networks to balance costs, increase flexibility, and expand market access. Importantly, medtech leaders can invest in quality capabilities that are deeply embedded in business processes.",
            " Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations continue to influence stakeholder decision making and are an opportunity to create a new vector for differentiation. Investors, customers, regulators, and employees report that ESG goals are a growing imperative for medtech companies. Leaders can start by focusing on three objectives in the near term: achieving net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions and reducing waste along the value chain, addressing health inequities by increasing device access to reduce disease burden, and promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace. A systematic approach to ESG can raise the value creation opportunity.",
            " M&A can help the medtech industry improve value creation, but reconfiguring a portfolio is daunting and companies will need to adapt their approaches to dealmaking to the current macroeconomic environment. For example, earnings growthârather than simply top-line growthâis driving the valuations of large companies, which is, in turn, shrinking the pool of attractive potential targets. Despite this and other challenges, the current environment is promising for medtech M&A because high-growth companies are more affordable. Medtech leaders could reconsider the value of large deals, more selectively target programmatic M&A, and invest more corporate venture capital to access early-stage innovations. Medtech leaders could also divest businesses and rebalance their portfolios.",
            " China will continue to be a critical market for multinational medtech companies, but the growth path has become more complex and challenging. Commercial pressures are mounting as a result of volume-based procurement, shifts in hospital reimbursements, coordinated localization efforts, and intensifying competition from China-based companies. Yet many general managers of multinational medtechsâ China-based businesses remain confident about the opportunities. Multinationals in China can consider strengthening and building new value-chain capabilities that fuel commercial results. A fresh look at value creation in China can frame a holistic discussion on the opportunities while opening the aperture beyond traditional strategic moves.",
            "At its core, medtech is an industry in which companies can do well by doing good. With a clear vision, a passion for innovation and excellence, and a steady guiding hand, medtech leaders can chart their next path of value creation for the benefit of patients and stakeholders."

Since 2018, medical affairs leaders across the industry have embraced the vision and core deliverables to become a true third pillar of the organization (see sidebar, âCore deliverables for medical affairs in 2030â). However, the journey is not yet complete. Progress in truly transforming medical affairs has been hindered by capability gaps, budgetary constraints, organizational misalignment, and competing priorities. Despite these challenges, the case for medical affairs to play a leading role is stronger than ever, and now is the time to act decisively. To help catalyze this change, this paper lays out how medical affairs leaders can take bold steps forward to execute and scale the vision (Exhibit 1).",

Medical affairs teams will likely look significantly different in 2030, with broader skill sets supplementing existing clinical expertise. Analytics and digital and data talent will need to be actively cultivated by hiring different types of profiles, rotating talent to and from other functions, investing in competency-building programs, and establishing diverse medical teams with various areas of expertise within them.

In the future, pharma companies will likely use AI and RWE analytics more holistically and with greater sophistication and agility, unlocking billions in value across their portfolio. Evidence generation will also likely become more collaborative going forward, developed in partnership with industry, academic physicians, and others. Although many evidence generation activities sit outside their department, medical affairs leaders are well positioned to identify evidence gaps because of their deep knowledge of physician, patient, and payer needs and drive initiatives and change across cross-functional teams. Here are three points for leaders to consider:",
            "By 2030, medical affairs will dramatically broaden the stakeholders it engages with, moving beyond key opinion leaders to scientific exchange with community physicians, payers, and other value-based decision makers and more in coordination with other external-facing teams. Digital engagement will be the only scalable medical affairs solution to measurably reduce suboptimal care delivery across large patient populations. An unpublished 2022 McKinsey survey of US physicians found that more than a quarter of them want less face-to-face and more digital pharma engagement over the next few years. Sixty percent of respondents said the integration of pharma company interactions across channels was crucial to their experience. In the past few years, most medical affairs teams have begun building new digital channels, content formats, and approaches for tailoring the engagement to various HCP segments; however, it appears no organization is delivering the envisioned orchestration of channels for an integrated experience (Exhibit 3).",
            "Commercial organizations have made more progress using analytics to understand HCP preferences and provide tailored engagement to the needs of the individual HCP and others. Some data and analytics may be leveraged compliantly by medical affairs, but modules specific to medical affairs will need to be developed to measure medical impact on HCP education, clinical decision making, and patient outcomes. To realize the full potential of engagement excellence, medical affairs leaders can invest in the following:",
            "The full journey to orchestrated engagement is not a minor upgrade to existing capabilities but an iterative, step-by-step journey over a multiyear transformation. Moving toward digital can reshape or replace traditional medical affairs roles, particularly how MSLs engage HCPs. Robust metrics can help leaders assess the impact of each step and, most importantly, incorporate new ways of working across medical affairs and other functions.",
            "Achieving each of the five priorities outlined in this paper will have a significant impact on patients and on the medical affairs team. Because the priorities are strongly interdependent, the full potential of transformative patient benefits can come from the successful implementation of all five simultaneously. Not all organizations will be prepared to invest now in the full-scale medical affairs transformation laid out here, but this vision should be a cross-industry rallying cry, mobilizing medical affairs to prepare for the future. Progress within an individual company may be uneven, with some regions or assets moving faster than others.

However, McKinsey analysis of the emissions profile of a representative pharmaceutical company shows that about 30 percent of emissions can be abated by levers with positive net present values (NPVs), meaning they lead to cost savings, and approximately 15 percent of emissions can be addressed by NPV-neutral levers.

In fact, by focusing on only three suppliers in the tier-n value chain, a company with five million metric tons of emissions and 2,000 suppliers could abate 35 percent of its emissions.",
            "Product and packaging redesign has the potential to achieve the dual mission of reducing carbon emissions and lowering cost. In fact, McKinsey analysis of select products shows that carbon emissions can be reduced by 30 percent, with cost savings of 10 percent.",
            "On this point, life sciences companies can adopt sustainable-by-design principles, including designing for higher recycled content and component-to-component recycling, decreasing material content in end products, developing better disassembly, and improving sorting approaches and technologies. For example, one company evaluated design levers through product analysis, identified initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint and costs at the same time, and validated the initiatives with R&D, procurement, and customer feedback. Based on the results, the company was able to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 40 percent and costs by 24 percent.",
            "With more companies ramping up their net-zero commitments, the demand for low-carbon feedstock will outpace supply and result in a significant supplyâdemand mismatch as early as 2030.",
            " On this point, McKinsey research has found that in 2035, the demand for sustainable methanol, a process chemical for many APIs, could be two to three times higher than the available supply.",
            "To encourage investment in R&D or production capacity for lower-carbon materials, life sciences companies can work with their suppliers to establish purchase agreements for large quantities of materials or even directly finance innovation and production-capacity increases for the low-emission materials they require.",
            "End-of-life solutions typically center on collaborations with healthcare delivery organizations, given the amount of waste generated in hospitals, and for this reason primarily apply to medtech companies. Here, materials recycling can abate approximately 10 percent of total emissions at relatively low cost or even with potential savings. On this point, some life sciences players are developing advanced-recycling capabilities.",
            "End-of-life solutions involve both new business models and circular modes of operation. On the business model end, life sciences companies can create value through buyback programs, for example. And on the operations side, they can enhance circularity by developing refurbishments for second-life capabilities and zero-landfill or -incineration solutions. For example, an American multinational medtech company provides reprocessing and remanufacturing services for single-use medical devices that optimize financial and environmental sustainability.",
            "Although life sciences companies have to deal with near-term profit-and-loss pressures, they still need to accelerate their decarbonization efforts, given the long time to develop lower-carbon products, the limited ability to change product footprints, and the need to build up lower-carbon sourcing capabilities. In addressing sustainability in life sciences, there is potential to limit the negative impact of climate change and to ensure the continuity of supply. Based on the track records of other industries, the strategic benefits of being a first mover far outweigh the temporary cost of capital investmentâin regard not only to social, patient, or environmental benefits but also to revenue (potentially by locking in additional volume) and managing cost (by securing contracts before green premiums significantly increase). Considering all these points, it is critical that life sciences companies take action today to accelerate the transition to net zero.",

        "description": "Animal production will continue to play an important role in feeding a growing world population. Biotechnology can help make it more sustainable, supporting a global path to net zero.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " executive vice president for agriculture and industrial biosolutions at Novozymes, which develops enzymes and microbes to improve animal health and feed efficiency. Harry Bowcott, a McKinsey senior partner and leader of the firmâs Sustainability Practice in the United Kingdom and Ireland, talked with Tina about biotechnologyâs potential in making animal production more sustainable and the need for collaboration, both along the value chain and among sectors, to successfully transition to a net-zero economy.",
            "Tina, how do you see the role of biotech in animal production?",
            " Biotech is very important. It can mean many different things, but Iâm most interested in âwhiteâ biotechnologyâwhich adds the enzymes, microbes, and other living cells to animal feed or is used to clean water in aquacultureâbecause it can support sustainable animal production in many ways. For example, biotech is already leading to higher yields, so that less feed is necessary to get the same output; it might also reduce the use of antibiotics.",
            "What role can sustainable animal production play in the global transition to a net-zero economy?",
            " There is a lot of talk today about how alternative proteins will nourish the ever-growing world population. Alternative proteins will play an important role, alongside animal production, but they will not replace it. Market trends suggest that animal production will grow for many years because it is an integral part of feeding the increasing population, so our focus should be making animal production as sustainable as possible. Novozymes has a portfolio of solutions not only for animal production but also for alternative proteins, because we see both as a part of a sustainable future of food production.",
            " Should this interface between animal production and alternative proteins be viewed as a competition among companies or an opportunity to collaborate?",
            " I donât think competition is the answer. While alternative proteins and animal production both have a role to play in sustainable food systems, they are different tools in the toolbox, and the industry should see them as coexisting. It is far more important for the industry to cooperate to influence stakeholders, including the broader population, to move in a more sustainable direction. I firmly believe in partnerships and coalitions, and agriculture is an area where we can collaborate more closely to achieve a more sustainable future.",
            "What are some exciting innovations that could come to the market soon?",
            " I can tell you about three specific examples of innovative products, and then Iâd like to highlight an area where I see a need for more innovation.",
            "The first example is a product developed by Novozymes that enables more sustainable animal production by reducing the use of antibiotics in poultry farms. We are commercializing this product with the Dutch biotech company DSM. The second innovation is a DSM product that reduces methane emissions from ruminants. This product is still in its infancy, but it is in an area where I see sustainability and innovation going hand in hand. A third product, also developed by Novozymes, supports the use of alternative and local feeds so that you get more benefit from your feed, which can increase sustainability in the global supply chain.",
            "Finally, I believe more sustainability technology and innovation are needed at the farm level; we need to think of the farmâs entire carbon account, how we can measure it, and how technology can help. Such information will lead to better financing. We also need to transition to AI technologies to learn how they can optimize operations to benefit the climate and the individual farmer. Right now, with increased inflation and high raw-material prices, farmers are struggling, but innovation and technologies can support them. Itâs important that innovative solutions not only help to optimize farm sustainability but also to help farmers with their bottom line. Data, technology, and finances form a triangle; they need to go hand in hand to create that sustainability revolution.",
            " Thatâs the challengeâtrying to manage all these things together. You touched on the need for the farmer to meet the bottom line, but who will pay for such innovations?",
            "It may sound expensive, but it doesnât need to be. Sustainability is a shared responsibility, and consumers will have to pay more for sustainable products. Farmers cannot absorb all the costs.",
            " So much of the change we need to bring about seems to include this notion of collaborating differently, whether in the public or private sector or in ecosystems within the private sector. But what does collaboration really mean? How can we make it work?",
            " I have a lot of experience in collaboration. It sounds nice but can be very difficult. To collaborate successfully, itâs important to have an aligned strategy or a desire for a common future. You need to have that left, right, and center as you progress in the partnership. It is also important to keep the end goal in mind. And for a partnership to deliver more than the sum of its parts, you have to give now and then. The joy of partnerships is having skills, business models, and geographical elements that complement one another. You need to be able to see that working together will lead to synergies.",
            " A recent impressive example of collaboration involved a postal logistics company. A segment of its customer base was prepared to pay a green premium for net-zero parcel delivery, so the company offered to commit its net-zero parcel volume to a particular shipper, which could borrow against that future volume to retrofit its vehicles. Suddenly, four playersâa postal logistics player, a shipper, a bank, and an ammonia fuel cell producerâwere working together along a value chain in a completely different way to accelerate a customer objective.",
            "Thatâs a perfect example of how collaboration can work. For sustainable animal production, you need the farmer, the financing, and the animal health and nutrition providers working together to secure a sustainable future. We are all in this together, so I encourage consulting with peers in other sectors about the collaborative ecosystems they are creating as we transition toward a net-zero global economy.",

        "description": "Life sciences innovation and healthcare advancement depend on data. Todayâs data fails to offer a complete picture of womenâs health. What can be done?",
        "paragraphs": [
            " data is at the center of engagement and decision making. Healthcare and life sciences are no exception: data is central to discussions about public health and is core to enabling continued scientific advancement. The accelerated digitalization of healthcare during the pandemic has only expanded the amount of health-related data availableâand cemented the key role that it plays in care delivery, disease prediction and diagnosis, biopharma and medtech innovation, and patient outcomes.",
            "Despite the exponential growth in data generated across the healthcare ecosystem, notable gaps remain. One such area is womenâs health, in which gaps span the entire data value chainâfrom defining womenâs health (preâdata generation) to diagnosing (data generation) to tracking at the national level (data collection) to translating data into insights at the global level through epidemiological studies (data analysis). These data disparities ultimately influence health outcomes for women globally by creating blind spots in the insights that drive research design, investment decisions, and pipeline priorities. Certain subsets of women, such as those of different backgrounds, sexual orientations, and gender identities, are more vulnerable to the gaps and negative effects of these blind spots.",
            " Furthermore, insufficient availability and analysis of women-specific health data undermine advancements in disease-state understanding and limit asset discovery opportunities across medical conditions with meaningful unmet need.",
            "This article highlights these disparities and explores options to remedy them.",
            "Health-related data has numerous sources and is analyzed for different applications. This article explores examples of data gaps in womenâs health at key moments across the health data value chain (Exhibit 1).",
            "The following sections examine these examples in greater detail.",
            "Good data sets begin with good definitions. Without clear definitions, the metrics to track and the conclusions to draw remain murky. However, at present there is no one definition of âwomenâs health.â",
            "Historically, womenâs health was largely defined as âreproductive health.â",
            " More recently, academics and clinicians have used a more expansive lens, recognizing that sex is a significant factor in the development and progression of many diseases.",
            " The National Academy on Womenâs Health Medical Education defines womenâs health as âdevoted to facilitating the preservation and wellness of and prevention of illness in women and includes screening, diagnosis and management of conditions that are unique in women, are more common in women, are more serious in women, and have manifestations, risk factors or interventions that are different in women.â",
            "For the purposes of this analysis, we define âwomenâs healthâ as encompassing both female-specific conditions, including those tied to female reproduction or female biology, and general health conditions that may affect women differently, such as cardiovascular diseases, or disproportionately, such as autoimmune diseases (Exhibit 2).",
            " It is crucial to understand sex-driven differences, as todayâs care models often ignore those differences, resulting in health outcomes that can vary by sex (often to womenâs disadvantage).",
            "Insurance claims dataâparticularly in the United Statesâprovides critical insight into the nature of health conditions and how they are treated. These data sets have inherent limitations, as their primary use for physicians is for billing purposes. However, this data is high quality and widely used, and thus the analysis for this article uses diagnosis codes on claims as a proxy for overall diagnosis rates.",
            "According to US claims data from January 2019 through August 2022, the prevalence of womenâs health conditions (estimated by epidemiological data sources",
            ") is roughly five times that of their documented diagnoses. In other words, for every one woman diagnosed with a womenâs health condition, roughly four go undiagnosed. In comparison, the difference between epidemiological prevalence and documented diagnoses for menâs health conditions narrows to roughly 1.5 times (Exhibit 3).",
            "While this disconnection between prevalence and diagnosis indicates an inconsistency in womenâs health data across various sources, such sex-based differences may also reflect structural drivers, such as biases in care delivery. Implicit biases, defined as âattitudes and beliefs about race, ethnicity, age, ability, gender, or other characteristics that operate outside our conscious awareness and can be measured only indirectly,â have been found to be associated with âdiagnostic uncertainty.â",
            " This phenomenon is corroborated by surveyed patients: 20 percent of women say a healthcare provider has ignored or dismissed their symptoms, compared with 14 percent of men.",
            "Furthermore, we found that the sex of the diagnosing physician appears to be correlated with the likelihood of being diagnosed with a condition. In other words, in the claims data we analyzed, women appear to be more likely to be diagnosed with a female-specific condition, including menopause, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and endometriosis, if their physician is a woman. In our analysis of claims data, women represent approximately 40 percent of primary care physicians (PCPs) but nearly 50 percent of PCPs documenting diagnoses of these key womenâs health conditions (Exhibit 4).",
            "As Caroline Criado Perez writes in her book ",
            ", âItâs not always easy to convince someone a need exists if they donât have that need themselves.â",
            " Given that claims data informs life sciences investment decisions, âblind spotsâ in these data sets may contribute to a perception of less unmet need and less need for continued innovation.",
            "These biases in care delivery are also likely reinforced during medical training. Out of 112 internal-medicine residency programs reviewed in a 2016 study, approximately 25 percent did not include menopause in the core curriculum, 30 percent did not include contraception, nearly 40 percent did not include PCOS, and more than 70 percent did not include infertility.",
            " These educational gaps are present even in programs dedicated to womenâs health: a survey of US obstetrics and gynecology residents found that fewer than two in ten receive formal training in menopause medicine, but seven in ten would like to receive it.",
            "The rate of underdiagnosis for women is more striking in light of data that shows that women are, on average, more likely to seek out care. A 2013 Kaiser survey found that 68 percent of men and 81 percent of women identified a clinician they see for routine care, and women were more likely than men to have seen a provider in the past two years (91 percent versus 75 percent).",
            "Globally, the quality and quantity of womenâs health data collection is uneven. The World Bank tracks country-level reporting rates of gender-specific healthcare indicators and finds significant gaps. For example, in 2020, less than 10 percent of countries reported data related to female access to contraception. This lack of visibility undermines the ability to understand drivers of maternal and child health, maternal mortality, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV/AIDS.",
            " And while data availability related to contraceptive use has improved, many countries still only provide data for married women. Less than 5 percent of countries reported 2020 data on menstrual material usage, which is a critical indicator of public health, gender equity, and human rights.",
            "The availability of sex-specific health data also differs by country. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, 76 percent of high-income countries reported COVID-19 case data by sex, compared with 37 percent of low-income countries.",
            " Sex-disaggregated data provides important insights into the biological mechanisms and socioeconomic risk factors that drive disease prevention and may translate to the development of more effective biopharma (and other) interventions by sex. Without it, the picture of global womenâs health remains incomplete, particularly in lower-income countries.",
            "In addition to data published by individual nations, the global burden of disease (GBD) is often used by clinicians, payers, researchers, analysts, and policy makers to understand the evolving global healthcare landscape. The GBD is the worldâs most comprehensive observational epidemiological study, spanning 204 countries, 369 diseases and injuries, and 87 risk factors.",
            "However, traditional metrics tracked in the GBD may not capture the full scale of need in womenâs health. Using the GBD tool of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), we investigated the prevalence and burden of disease associated with select womenâs health conditions (Exhibit 5). Of the conditions defined in this analysis,",
            " nearly 60 percent of prevalence data was attributed to female-specific diseases such as maternal health, contraception, and menopause. However, these same female-specific conditions represent less than 25 percent of disability-adjusted life years",
            " associated with womenâs health conditions. In other words, traditional health metrics do not accurately reflect the widespread suffering associated with female-specific conditions.",
            "A delta between prevalence and disability-adjusted life years is not surprising in itself. However, the low disability-adjusted life years associated with female-specific conditions (some of which, such as menopause, are not tracked at all in the GBD) appear to meaningfully understate the disruption and suffering associated with female-specific conditions. For example:",
            "Data is foundational to our understanding of disease states and is a crucial catalyst for continued life-sciences innovation. A 2023 report from the Enterprise Strategy Group and Splunk found that leaders in key data-maturity metrics also excelled in product innovation; these leaders report a higher number of product launches per year and a higher share of revenue accounted for by new innovations.",
            "In womenâs health, data gaps coincide with lower rates of clinical development focused on womenâs health: excluding oncology, just 1 percent of biopharma pipeline assets and 2 percent of medtech novel approvals are directed at addressing womenâs health conditions.",
            " (Including oncology, the rates increase to 5 and 4 percent, respectively.) Without data to accurately document the extent and nature of conditions, there is a limited fact base to fuel innovationâin womenâs health specifically and in life sciences overall. But the opportunities to close gaps are plentiful and represent exciting opportunities for industry participants with a stake in improving womenâs health outcomes.",
            " The data gap is substantial and will take many hands and substantial effort to bridge. Todayâs clinical trials, diagnoses, and treatment plans are built on existing data sets, only some of which include thorough analysis of robust sex-disaggregated data. Fortunately, working to close the data gap in womenâs health could bring forth opportunities throughout the data value chain for life-sciences organizations, providers, payers, academics, and investors alike. The starting point is building a widely acknowledged definition of womenâs health that includes all relevant conditionsânot just those related to reproductive healthâand highlights the biological relevance of sex to health outcomes.",
            " At the regional and national levels, clinicians, academics, and researchers could benefit from updated guidance on the impact of sex-based differences on clinical outcomes, which demographic data to collect, and mechanisms for the collection of womenâs health data. Improving visibility into womenâs unmet medical needs will also require new mechanisms, incentives, and infrastructure to facilitate the generation of sex-disaggregated data. Some changes, such as those enhancing the understanding of sex-based differences in clinical outcomes, could have a substantial impact by creating a stronger foundation for womenâs health data collection and analysis. Incumbent health and life sciences companies could also take the lead in working with companies that have unanalyzed sex-disaggregated data.",
            " Clinician training in sex-specific biology and the implicit biases we know about today, with an emphasis on narrowing the gap between the prevalence of its condition and the volume of diagnoses, could help to improve health outcomes for women and critical sources of data generation. Once an expanded set of sex-disaggregated data is collected and assessed, that data can also guide future training on sex-based differences as data relates to healthcare research, clinical trials, pharmaceutical development, treatment, and more. Organizations that use clinical decision support systems to assist in clinical training may consider how a more robust set of sex-disaggregated data could improve models. The goal is to equip everyoneâfrom researchers to providers to payersâwith comprehensive training and tools built on best-in-class data practices.",
            " Investors could also seek out opportunities to fund new ventures focused on generating womenâs health data and understanding the impact of sex-driven differences on health outcomes. The successful models that led to the proliferation of precision medicine in other therapeutic areas, such as oncology-focused electronic medical records companies, could guide these new ventures. Investors, entrepreneurs, and established life-sciences incumbents each have a role to play in investing in this white space.",
            " Finally, stakeholders can consider how health metrics and studies are used, as well as the implications of those choices. Both key health outcome metrics and population-level analyses (for example, global epidemiological studies) should aim to accurately reflect the patient experience of different subpopulations. Revisiting and expanding these metrics could be a joint effort among governments, academics, clinicians, and public-health experts.",
            "Our collective understanding of disease burden drives not only health outcomes but also investment decisionsâand yet that understanding does not benefit from a comprehensive data set on women. The gaps are many, and women of different demographics feel the effects to varying degreesâbut a new commitment to raising the bar in womenâs health data could unlock the next generation of life-sciences innovations and care delivery for women globally. Moreover, taking care of women is taking care of communities. Everyone will benefit from a world with a comprehensive definition of womenâs health, diagnosis rates more in line with condition prevalence, nationally reported sex-disaggregated data, and global epidemiological studies that consider the full breadth of womenâs health experiences. The future of innovation in womenâs health is only as strong as the data value chain that supports it. Itâs time to close these gaps.",

            " is a good time to take stock of the life sciences industryâs digital maturity. This article provides ten observations from McKinseyâs work in this space, complemented by targeted analyses and a McKinsey survey conducted in November 2022 of one hundred digital and analytics (DnA) leaders in life sciences functional areas, such as R&D, manufacturing and supply chain (M&SC), commercial, and enabling functions such as finance and HR.",
            " Life sciences companies have historically lagged behind banking, telecom, retail, and other industries in digital maturity. A ",
            "Â from 2016 identified a multitude of factors that make life sciences companies slow to adopt DnA innovations, including not fully understanding healthcare practitionersâ (HCPs) decision journeys, challenges linking DnA to the broader business, and difficulty maintaining an efficient operating model. Has the pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital technologies, have life sciences companies caught up at all, and how far are they from realizing the full potential of digital and analytics?",

            "The results are sobering. The gaps with other industries are not closing, and the reported benefit to businesses is moderate. All players in the ecosystem can benefit from incorporating digital and analytics into every aspect of their operations to fully deliver on the promise for patients and societies. Here are our ten observations in detail.",
            " Despite efforts made over the past few years, life sciences companies still trail cross-industry leaders in digital maturity by a factor of two to three times in every key dimensionâstrategy, culture, organization, and capabilitiesâwithout any clear signs of catching up.",
            "Pharmaceutical companies (pharmacos) surveyed are slightly more mature than medical technology (medtech) companies: 55 percent of pharma DnA leaders say they have deployed some applications at scale, compared with 34 percent of medtech DnA leaders. Overall, commercial and R&D are more digitally mature than other functions, with more than 14 percent of DnA leaders in those areas reporting that digital applications are deployed at scale and are contributing tangible business value. Less than 6 percent of DnA leaders see the same in M&SC and enabling functions.",
            "Life sciences has also struggled to execute on the idea of building novel digital businesses beyond digital solutions like apps supporting their existing products. The jury is still out on whether life sciences companies are the best owners of these, due to misalignment of incentives, the need for agility, and the capabilities needed.",
            " Life sciences DnA leaders surveyed estimate that digital and analytics drove a 5 to 15 percent bottom-line improvement in specific pockets of their functional areas over the past five years, yielding an annual global impact of $6 billion to $9 billion. This compares with an estimated $130 billion to $190 billion that the full application of digital solutions and innovation along the life sciences value chain could bring.",
            "The largest opportunities DnA could help unlock are derisking drug discovery, accelerating clinical trials, and reinventing engagement with HCPs. As a result, many leading companies are incorporating DnA into early-stage drug discovery and clinical development to shrink timelines and improve the probability of success. In addition, leading players are reinventing their interactions with healthcare providers and patients to provide enhanced and tailored experiences and achieve better treatment outcomes.",
            " The top 20 pharmacos and the top 20 medtech companies generated more than 1,700 DnA and life sciencesârelated patents in 2021, a growth surge of more than 70 percent over 2017 that finally allowed the industry to overtake the combined volumes of Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple. Publications also increased by 28Â percent in that period, reaching 650 last year.",
            "In other industries, such as retail banking, strategic and financial benefits accrue to digital innovators. Still, despite the recent burst in digital innovation, there is not yet a clear correlation between life sciences companiesâ digital maturity and their financial performance. This is probably because of long product development timelines and limited short-term benefits, especially in R&D, underlining the importance of defining and linking digital strategy to scientific and business value at every level of the organization.",
            " Funding along the life sciences value chain jumped from $5 billion in 2019 to more than $20 billion in 2021 (Exhibit 1), with more than 45Â percent of the funding in commercial solutions. Funding in research and development ranked second, totaling $6.4 billion, with almost equal interest from investors in research and early development ($3 billion) and development, regulatory, and safety ($3.4 billion).",
            "Year-to-date funding and digital-health stock indexes, such as the MSCI ACWI IMI Digital Health Index, for 2022 have almost halved compared with 2021, partially because of a general public-market correction. However, they are still twice their 2019 levels.",
            "The US life sciences sector still leads Europe and Asia in DnA investments. The top 20 pharmacos and the top 20 medtech companies made slightly more DnA-related major deals in the United States than in the European Union over the past five yearsâ32 versus 26â but on average, the US deals were about five times larger, $700 million versus $150 million in the European Union.",
            " This is a strong indicator of the difference across continents in the level and pace of innovation.",
            "Globally, the big three tech players are edging out the top 40 life sciences companies as leading strategic investors. The top 40 life sciences players have invested almost $20Â billion in DnA deals since 2017, but less than $6 billion in the past three years; big tech players invested $10 billion in tech-related healthcare deals, $8 billion of that in the past three years. Big tech players can leverage their ability to generate cash flow to fuel their M&A activities, while life sciences companies tend to prioritize asset acquisitions over DnA deals.",
            " The hiring rate of DnA talent by life sciences companies is accelerating slightly, from 2 to 4 percent a year over the past five years to an expected 3 to 5 percent a year over the next three. Only 10 percent of respondents said they had grown the talent in their functional areas by more than 30 percent, and only 9 percent said that they are targeting such an expansion over the next three years. Hiring is generally more robust in R&D and commercial, and itâs expected to remain so.",
            "Similarly, leaders expect to grow their DnA spending by another 10 to 15 percent over the next three years, starting from todayâs baseline of 8 to 12 percent of their functionâs budgets. Only 7 percent of leaders expect to increase their investment by more than 30 percent over the next three years.",

Cloud and industrialized ML allow life sciences companies to adopt new AI approaches more reliably and at a faster pace and larger scale, accelerating tech-driven innovation.",
            "Cloud technologies are increasingly being embraced by life sciences to speed tech-enabled business transformations; in 2021, more than 80 percent of the top 20 global pharma and medtech companies were operating in the cloud. In addition, companies are increasingly leveraging the cloud to shift IT infrastructure management and to fill gaps in their software development and analytics capabilities, buying software as a service rather than building and operating it themselves.",
            "Despite the high media attention, longer-term bets such as quantum technologies, Web3, advanced connectivity, and immersive reality together account for only about 15 percent of life sciences tech investments.",
            "Beyond focusing on a single tech trend, the research shows that DnA leaders could consider investing in a combination of trends to unlock the most innovation and new sources of value. For instance, life sciences companies could accelerate drug discovery, create more personalized treatments, and optimize treatment plans for patients by leveraging a combination of Al and ML, cloud computing, quantum technologies, and bioengineering.",
            " DnA leaders are betting that the areas that have brought the most value to date will be the primary value drivers for the next few years.",
            "In the past three to five years, each function has had two or three areas in which digital and analytics brought noticeable changes and moderate impact. These included disease state and target understanding in research and early development, clinical trial planning and execution in development, regulatory and safety, end-to-end supply chain in M&SC, go-to-market and field force effectiveness in commercial, unmet medical need in medical, and shared services productivity in enabling functions.",
            " The top hurdle to scaling life sciences DnA in 2020 was a lack of leadership support and misaligned strategy, but that is no longer the case (Exhibit 2). Instead, the key challenges today include the following:",
            " Two-thirds of life sciences DnA leaders say they have focused on developing a value-linked blueprint and strategy, and around 60 percent indicate they have also made progress in setting up the âhardâ capabilities to scale DnA, such as digital and analytics solutions (62 percent of respondents), data architecture",
            " (65 percent), and technological infrastructure (56 percent). The adoption of these hard capabilities has improved by 1.5 to 2.3 times over 2017. On the âsoftâ capabilities front, the adoption of appropriate talent strategies and agile operating models has improved from 29 percent in 2017 to 46 percent, and the adoption and scaling of DnA has improved from 10 percent in 2017 to 46 percent today, though both are still underdeveloped.",
            "Our survey results suggest that many life sciences companies are about to reach an inflection point in their DnA transformation journey and could benefit from evaluating the options ahead. Broadly, there are three archetypes for scaling DnA: DnA-targeted partnerships and acquisitions, armâs-length digital business building, and digital transformation of the core business, which is arguably the hardest but generally delivers the highest long-term value.",
            "In December 2022, at a McKinsey-hosted Quantum Jump event on digital and analytics transformation, 61 percent of participants indicated their businesses have adopted an agile approach to digitally transforming their core business.",
            " Only 24 percent of participants indicated DnA-targeted partnerships and acquisitions, and 15 percent picked armâs-length digital business building.",
            " DnA leaders regard a leadership-backed, impact-driven blueprint (25 percent) and fit-for-purpose and scalable digital and analytics solutions (27Â percent) as the two most important factors for scaling DnA. This is reflected in how they have approached DnA transformations so far. Although the âsoftâ capabilities are still underdeveloped, pharma DnA leaders have started to shift their focus to adoption and scaling (19 percent), whereas medtech DnA leaders still focus less on these. Across the board, medtech companies have invested less, have fewer DnA applications with visible business value deployed at scale, and still have less focus on the soft elements. Although medtech companies are behind pharma companies in digital maturity, their successful adoption of DnA can help provide better products and services to patients. In turn, this will help close the digital maturity gap between life sciences and digital leaders. The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the life sciences industry to rethink its approach to adopting digital and analytics. Thanks to some initial proof points and investments in hard capabilities, life sciences companies now have an opportunity and need to accelerate and scale to capture DnAâs full value.",
            "The answer to the industryâs challenges may lie in fusing digital and analytics with those competencies that have historically made life sciences successful: innovation, HCP, and patient relevance. By bringing these capabilities together, the industry could change the game and deliver greater benefits for patients. If it doesnât, it risks missing out on much of its potential.",

        "description": "Investing in understanding the needs of customers and the healthcare ecosystem in the early stages of innovation can boost performance and reduce the risk of failure.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " in product design is required by regulatory processes in medtech, it continues to grow in importance as companies build on their standard of care delivery to focus more closely on meeting customer needs and as they achieve breakthrough growth by delivering against unmet needs. Many medtech companies focus on addressing customer centricity from a marketing and commercial perspective. In doing so, they may not be giving one aspect of customer centricity the attention it deserves: the role it should play in enabling innovation.",
            "Customer centricity is an iterative approach to delivering value to end users across the life cycle of a product or service. In medtech, the terms âcustomer centricityâ and âcustomerâ have broad implications, extending beyond end users to include healthcare providers, physicians, and caregivers as well as patients. âCustomerâ can also encompass the use of a device in different use cases. Because healthcare is an ecosystem, companies should take into account dependencies on other healthcare stakeholders, including payers, providers, and governments.",
            "Getting customer-centric innovation right leads to better patient outcomes. It can also lead to the treatment of more patients, shorter time to market for products, cost reductions, and improved sustainability. For example, some medtech companies end up developing products with high-cost features that are used by less than 10 percent of users.",
            "Innovating in a customer-centric manner takes more than good processes. For many medtech companies, it requires a fundamental change in mindset toward creating value for customers. Itâs not easy, but the upsides of superior financial performance and improved customer satisfaction can be significant.",
            "This article focuses on what it takes to get innovation right to address customer needs in an increasingly customer-centric medical world.",
            "Following a customer-centric approach can enable medtech companies to deliver better health outcomes by simultaneously meeting customer needs more effectively and improving companiesâ financial performance.",
            "Prior McKinsey research that tracked the design practices of 300 publicly listed companies in multiple countries and industries over the five-year period from 2013 to 2018 found a strong correlation between high customer centricity (reflected in high McKinsey Design Index scores) and superior business performance.",
            " Top-quartile performers in medtech in the McKinsey Design Index generated 42 percent higher revenue and more than twice the TSR than their peers in that five-year period (Exhibit 1).",
            "Customer centricity supports corporate performance in two ways. First, it drives growth by increasing adoption and customer retention by addressing unmet needs. Products are refined through continuous learning, testing, and iterating with customers, thus delivering improved customer usability and satisfaction. Second, customer centricity can reduce both R&D costs and the cost of goods sold. In R&D, companies that test early prototypes with customers achieve better product definition and avoid costly changes. Companies that create targeted solutions tailored to the unique needs of customers tend to achieve more market share than one-size-fits-all solutions. Customer-centric products also tend to have less complexityâand lower production costs as a result.",
            "While the benefits of a customer-centric approach are clear, implementing customer centricity in innovation is challenging. Successful implementation can often mean a change in mindset at the leadership level, and it requires buy-in from colleagues in tech and design, among other parts of the business. In a recent Harvard Business Review study of more than 400 executives, more than half of respondents indicated that their companies lacked the internal processes to support customer experience programs.",
            " Only 36 percent of respondents indicated that their companies were forward-looking in terms of customer experience management.",
            "The pitfalls in implementing customer-centric innovation in medtech can be numerous. In this article, we focus on three of the most frequent ones we have observed.",
            "First, only addressing certain customersâ needs can create utility gaps. About half of the companies surveyed in a recent McKinsey Value of Design study donât conduct customer research before generating their first design ideas and specifications.",
            " Medtech players often substitute input from key opinion leaders and âpower usersâ for input from broader stakeholders. In doing so, they may miss what average users need most.",
            "Second, addressing only scientific challenges with a technical-feasibility mindset can lead to suboptimal product definition. While looking at scientific gaps may lead to scientific discoveries and new therapy areas, it may not necessarily address the gaps in care delivery and the role of social factors. In the United States, for example, medical care involving doctors, drugs, and medical devices typically accounts for only 10 to 20 percent of health outcomes.",
            " Factors such as social circumstances, environmental influences, and behavior and habits play a much larger role. Customer-centric innovation considers the entire care ecosystem beyond the scientific gap. An instructive example comes from one company that sought to roll out a remote electrocardiogram (ECG) device in a middle-income country. While the device could identify heart diseases earlier by letting users conduct an ECG from home, it still required someone to read and interpret the ECG result and for the patient to receive immediate medical care. While this device solved a scientific gap, it did not address all the needs of the care ecosystem and, as a result, was not successful.",
            "Finally, there is a risk that customer centricity can result in the overspecification of products. A feature-oriented mindset can sometimes be restrictive for creating breakthrough solutions that meet patientsâ needs. It may also create an unnecessarily expensive product when a simpler and cheaper product may deliver better value to the customer. The World Health Organization identified several reasons why some medical devices do not meet customersâ needs, including a lack of high-quality information on what approach delivers the best result, the cost effectiveness of innovative technologies, and a desire to provide the newest technology for its own sake.",
            "Customer-centric innovation starts with research in the discovery phase and extends all the way to the launch (Exhibit 2). The cost of change dramatically increases toward the end of development, so understanding customer needs and locking in requirements early reduces the risk of expensive late-stage changes, costly delays, and challenges of approval, among other risks.",
            "Investing in customer centricity in the discovery phase often uncovers complex and sometimes hidden needs and provides deep insights into the behaviors and constraints of healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers. This can guide researchers in prioritizing research opportunities, and it reduces uncertainty of product requirements. For many companies, the discovery phase is performed solely by the marketing team. However, in our experience, companies that take a cross-functional approach to the discovery phase often create products that better meet customer needs.",
            "Some companies are involving customers early in the process, using design research to gain a much deeper understanding of their needs. The most revealing design research method is clinical immersion, or âethnography,â during which product development teams and design researchers go into the field to observe patients and users and their environments. Observation is the most effective way to uncover needs, since people rarely do what they report doing. Clinical immersion is not limited to how patients are treated but also includes the environment in which the treatment takes place. Examples include environment of procedure rooms, the skill sets of medical coworkers, and basic infrastructure. Clinical immersion allows engineers to develop a deep understanding of workflows and empathy for customers in a certain ecosystem, which can be missed if relying on expert interviews alone.",
            "Some of this ethnography is âhypothesis ledââthat is, focusing where there is a very tangible product need. In other cases, the ethnography is âdiscovery led,â with no preconceived notion of the product or service. As well as revealing peopleâs needs more effectively than in interviews, clinical immersion can shift the engineerâs mind from features to needs and bring breakthrough ideas to the market. Engineers build empathy for users and become their advocates for the duration of product development. Some in the medtech sector view clinical immersion as expensive and labor-intensive. However, companies usually can conduct clinical immersion with just two engineers (and potentially one person from marketing) with a time investment of several weeks.",
            "Holistically understanding the needs of customers requires that companies follow a robust process in which needs are traced during the development process. Traceability in innovation reduces the risk of costly mistakes, such as targeting the wrong customer segment and missing features or poorly implementing them. It creates value by informing product or service requirements.",
            "Traceable techniques include the following:",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions were game changers for clinical immersion because they required new virtual capabilities for the in-market team and rapid adoption of collaboration and immersive technologies. Virtual clinical immersion offered a rapid, cost-effective, and scalable alternative to in-person clinical immersion. The level of research output was similar to in-person immersion, with collaboration across multiple geographies and without limits on the number of observers or research participants. For example, during the peak of the pandemic, one company used virtual clinical immersion to understand the unmet needs of healthcare providers in primary-care settings when screening patients with vision impairment and other eye complaints. The aim here was to enable prompt referral of cases. Through collaboration with local facilitators; use of state-of-the-art immersive capture technology (including 3-D scans of clinical environments by smartphone, as well as the capturing of contextual knowledge of clinical environments via virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) headsets); and synthesis via an online-collaboration platform, the team was able to identify unmet needs, develop the concept, and test it with end users.",
            "Leading companies are changing the way they define products, moving away from a technical feasibilityâbased mindset to a more holistic approach that balances feasibility, customer desirability, and business viability.",
            "This is particularly important when a medtech company designs products for a new market. Many companies introduce the same products that they have sold in existing markets, which may not deliver the same value in different environments. Focusing on specifications that add value for patients in a particular market is essential for delivering better clinical outcomes.",
            "One example of this is the design of a medical device to reduce the rate of neonatal death from asphyxia. Through two months of clinical immersion at top-tier, ground-level, and referral hospitals, one company identified about 50 unmet needs. The clinical-immersion process, however, identified several features in the incoming product that were not required. This led to a very simple device that met user needs but that also reduced the cost by 75 percent compared to the companyâs original model.",
            "Such examples are just a few of the ways in which the medtech sector is moving toward providing products that fit the ecosystem and meet specific customer needs. Customer centricity in the early stages of innovation can be challengingâbut its rewards of better products, greater value, and the reduced risk of costly failure or expensive late-stage changes can be significant.",
            "Customer-centric innovation is a journey. It is important to start at a modest scale and build, based on experience, capacity, capability, and the characteristics of each product. Throughout the process, companies need to gauge and understand the extent to which current products or future product ideas address both unmet needs of the consumer and the medtech ecosystem. They also need to be realistic about their own ability to deliver. This is a journey often best approached by starting small with pilot programs and only then making the call about whether to invest across the organization or the product portfolio.",

            "Thatâs been especially evident in recent yearsâwith some notable shifts. M&A activity has increased over the past five years, but steady growth in deal volume and relatively stable deal value (except in 2019) indicates that the relatively small number of mega deals seen in the early 2010s have given way to a greater number of smaller transactions (ExhibitÂ 1). Partnerships have increased over the same period, including some notably unconventional pairings in therapeutic areas not known for collaboration and between players teaming up for the first time. There have also been upticks in deals focused on digital assets, as the industryâs demand for big data and advanced analytics intensifies, and on more localized deals around the globe, as companies look to emerging markets as growth engines.",
            "Combined, these macro trends suggest a potential inflection point for the industry. Companies that recognize the new opportunities in this dealmaking landscape and pursue them programmaticallyâthat is, through a minimum of two small or midsize deals a year with a market capitalization of 20 to 30 percentâwill be best able to strengthen their portfolios with accelerated growth and value creation.",
            "Companies in the biopharma sector have had significant levels of available cash to make deals. McKinseyâs analysis shows that the top 12 biopharma companies will have more than $290Â billion in cash available to invest at the end of 2022, nearly double their pre-COVID-19 levels.",
            "But there is more to this story than the size of biopharma coffers alone. After all, these companies could use their cash to pay down debt or deliver dividends to shareholders. Digging deeper into the data, we have uncovered five key dealmaking macro trends.",
            "Active portfolio management is a key value driver for any company, and itâs essential for success in the biopharma industry, as it accelerates growth and fuels value creation. It allows companies to focus on their scientific and operational strengths, realign with areas of greatest patient need and growth potential, optimize synergies among various assets, and update their portfolio as key drugs lose exclusivity.

            "Divestituresâthe flip side of M&Aâare also an important element of active portfolio management. Divestiture activity has picked up over the past few years as most biopharma companies have continued to focus on their strategic cores in terms of both therapeutic areas and innovation (Exhibit 3). Since 2019, many of the industryâs largest players, including Lilly, Merck, Novartis, and Pfizer, have divested or spun off noninnovative pharmaceutical assets, such as established medicines and generics, and nonpharmaceutical assets in consumer health, animal health, and medical technologies. Some more recent announcements, such as Johnson & Johnsonâs spin-off of its consumer health business and Novartisâ spin-off of Sandoz, confirm a continuation of this trend, which can boost efficiency and performance.",

            ", and this trend is expected to continue (Exhibit 4). By buying innovation, biopharma companies can acquire at least partially derisked revenue and increase their chances of R&D success. Smaller biopharma companies are expected to drive more than two-thirds of revenue growth over the next five-plus years, making partnerships and acquisitions even more attractive for larger firms.",
            "In addition to increasing their M&A activity, biopharma companies have also intensified their partnership activity over the past several years. The COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented increase in unconventional partnerships between players that have not worked together before and in therapeutic areas not usually known for intercompany collaboration, like infectious diseases. Companies are also pursuing partnerships to explore new areas through shared capabilities and to derisk their investmentsâfor example, by using deferred payments and options in licensing deals.",
            "As the industry contends with rising discovery costs and external innovation becomes a more significant component of revenues, this dealmaking approach should continue to increase. It will become a popular element of the biopharma dealmaking toolbox.",
            "As the industry contends with rising discovery costs and external innovation becomes a more significant component of revenues, dealmaking activity should continue to increase.",
            "The power of big data and advanced analytics in the healthcare industry is not new, but as demand for them has surged, more deals have focused on digital assets. In 2020 alone, the top ten biopharma companies saw 28 deals totaling more than $2Â billion in valueâtwice the value compared to five years ago.",
            "While the pandemic fueled some of this activity, it is likely to continue as the industryâs need to manage decentralized clinical trials and adopt new digital management tools escalates. Biopharma companies will continue building their digital and AI capabilities across the value chain to create differentiated solutions. Indeed, since the beginning of 2022, several large biopharma players announced new partnership deals and achievements focused on data and analytics. Sanofi, for example, signed a research collaboration and licensing agreement with the AI company Exscientia. AstraZeneca announced the discovery of a novel AI-generated chronic kidney disease target from its collaboration with BenevolentAI.",

            "Actively rotating the portfolio requires an appetite for risk. It can be easier to default to known therapeutic areas or franchises, but while established medicines provide steady cash flows, they offer limited growth. To succeed in portfolio rotation, biopharma players must be prepared, both financially and culturally, to disrupt the status quo.",

The best programmatic dealmakers can chart a path incorporating a âbest of breedâ approach across assets, talent, and processes to maintain the innovation engine and accelerate the value capture.",
            " Successful partnerships must be structured thoughtfully. They require a long-term commitment from both parties, early agreement on guiding principles such as asset prioritization, and a good cultural fit to deliver long-term value. The unique nature of these transactions forces companies not only to size up a potential partner but also to make clear to that partner the value they bring to the table.",
            "Digital and analytics are hot topics, but the results of these deals can vary. In particular, companies seeking to shift to a product-plus-software model, which demands new capabilities such as AI and digital, often lower ROI expectations to start, and different customer expectations and behaviors will face significant challenges. When executed well, connected products can offer unmatched competitive differentiation, but companies must define their digital strategy and business model ahead of any transactions.",
            " While deals that expand a companyâs reach beyond the United States or Europe hold the promise of accelerated growth, they often require a different capability set and risk appetite. Companies that pursue these deals also must be comfortable with an unpredictable return profile, especially given recent changes in some countriesâ pricing regulationsâfor example, volume-based pricing in China. Furthermore, geopolitical disruptions can strain long-term cash flows, restricting M&A and dealmaking appetite in the respective regions. Companies that can invest with a growth mindset, frame these deals appropriately, and take advantage of varied deal structures can create a strong foothold for long-term value creation.",
            "The coming years will be an active time of accelerated dealmaking with great promise for value creation in the biopharma industryâespecially given the accumulation of cash by large companies and the lower prices of many potential targets resulting from the recent market downturn. Companies that can activate a portfolio rotation effort through programmatic M&A&D and deploy thoughtful dealmaking approaches, responding to market trends and opportunities, will be best positioned to advance their overall strategies and outperform their peers. As noted, doing so will not always be easy. But with a concerted effort by the C-suite and the strategy and business development teams, companies can maximize value by making deals effectively.",

Kite is the global leader in cell therapy with two FDA-approved CAR T-cell therapies in multiple blood cancer indications that have treated more than 11,000 patients worldwide. Kite products are approved in more than 20 countries and represent a new frontier in cancer treatment that has only been approved since 2017. McKinsey senior partner Laura Furstenthal sat down with Shaw for an in-depth conversation about Kiteâs therapies, what it means to put the patient first, and how she leads while science and circumstances rapidly change. What follows is an edited version of their conversation.",
            "  Before we get into questions about your work as Kiteâs CEO, I think it would be helpful to start with a laypersonâs description of CAR T-cell therapy. Most people are familiar with the idea of treating cancers with radiation and chemotherapy. Why is cell therapy considered so innovative and different?",

Those T cells are shipped to our cell therapy research labs. We have three cell therapy manufacturing facilities now. Then our research engineers, our cell therapy specialists, take that patientâs T cells, engineer them with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene, and help grow and expand them to fight the cancer. That bag of engineered cells gets shipped back to the patient in the hope of a cure for that patient.",
            " CAR T-cell therapy is newâit was only introduced as an FDA-approved treatment for adults in 2017. You joined Kite as CEO two years later. As a leader, how do you create strategies and set goals in an area that is growing and changing so rapidly?",
            " Things have changed so rapidly, not only year to year, but month to month. What I described to you about harnessing a patientâs own cells is called âautologous cell therapy.â When I first came to Kite in 2019, the thinking at the time was that autologous cell therapy would be quickly disrupted by donor cell therapy, and that within two years we would no longer need autologous cell therapy. But thatâs not whatâs happened. The durability of responses hasnât been as good as we would have liked with donor cell therapy; the side effect profile still requires hospitalization or staying close to a hospital. Weâve had to be adaptable and pivot.",
            "We also thought weâd be going into solid tumors next because weâre working in blood cancers now. What weâre actually seeing through the science is that maybe other diseases beyond cancer may come first. Weâve seen some great data on patients in immunology, for example, and in virology.",
            "We canât predict where that science is going to evolve, unfortunately. But if we stay nimble, we can evolve things very quickly. Some things might go faster than we thought. And new frontiers are appearing in front of us that we never even dreamed of three years ago.",
            "  What are you most proud of, so far, about being Kiteâs CEO? And what are you most excited about going forward for patients, for advancements in science, and for your employees?",
            " The last three years have been some of the most meaningful work in my 30-year career. To be able to bring something that is so life changing, that literally changes the way cancer is being treated, is fulfilling personally and professionally.",
            "We have five indications now in all different kinds of blood cancers. And we went from treating hundreds of patients to over 11,000 patients. With the hope of a cure for some cancers, itâs incredibly meaningful work.",
            "Our âtrue northâ at Kite is first, to focus on patients and to be able to reach as many patients as possible. We are now in over 20 countries, with patient access and reimbursement across five major continents. Weâre really trying to reach every patient whoâs eligible for CAR T-cell therapy.",
            "Second is thinking about our future. Today, we have about a 50 percent cure rate for patients living with certain blood cancers. These patients have typically been told they have only months of life left. But weâre not reaching every single patient. So, as we look at trying to reach more patients, itâs about reaching them through increasing the number of authorized treatment centers, bringing centers closer to where the patients are, and continuing to expand even beyond the 20 countries weâre in currently.",
            "Itâs also about earlier lines of therapy and trying to get more patients eligible within the same indications that we have today. And then as we look at the science and where weâre going in the futureâbecause only about half of patients respond to the therapyâour number-one goal is to try to figure out: How do we evolve our therapy so that more patients have a great response?",
            "  Letâs talk about patient access. This is a novel and expensive therapy and something that is manufactured in batches of one. How can patients afford it, and how can you ensure access to it?",
            " Patient access has so many dimensions to it, starting from when the patient is diagnosed. Are they or is their doctor even aware of or educated about the therapy? Then, how do they get to the place where they would undergo cell therapy? How far away do they live from an authorized treatment center?",
            "In response, weâre going direct to patients through digital education and through healthcare professionals. And weâre strengthening that referral route so that a community oncologist can refer their patient to a blood cancer specialist and an authorized treatment center.",
            "Once the patient is at the treatment center, they need to stay for four to six weeks, or sometimes longer if they have any side effect management that extends their stay. They need travel, lodging, and support for that piece of the journey as well. We now have over 315 authorized treatment centers worldwide, with 120 in the United States, where we started out with only 60.",
            "One of the things that I get asked a lot about Kite is, âThis is an expensive product. How do you justify the cost?â",
            "Weâve actually seen that when you use this one-time therapyâthereâs no need for additional therapies after thisâthat the healthcare system actually saves a lot of money. [In the US] Medicare is fully reimbursing. In Europe, weâve signed outcomes-based agreements in which we guarantee certain outcomes for a certain price. Taking a patient-outcome approach is something Iâd love to see happen in the United States.",
            "During the pandemic, we all came together in the healthcare system to focus on patients. I think focusing on patient outcomes and reimbursing for patient outcomes is how we can put the best interests of the patient in mind again.",
            "I think focusing on patient outcomes and reimbursing for patient outcomes is how we can put the best interests of the patient in mind again.",
            " You came into this role in 2019 and then COVID-19 hit. What can you tell us about leading through that experience, and how has the pandemic catalyzed change within Kite?",
            " We ship the cells in what we call a âdewar,â which looks like a little ",
            " R2-D2 machine robot. It keeps the cells frozen. That dewar gets shipped on a plane, and our team tracks that plane and those cells. Right at the outset of the pandemic, a dewar left on a plane from LAX [Los Angeles International Airport] to Chicago to be shipped to Europe, and once that dewar got to Chicago OâHare Airport, it sat there. The team was getting the alerts: one flight canceled, then another canceled, then nine flights canceled. We were all involved in this, being alerted, calling the airlines, calling everyone we could.",
            "We didnât think that those cells were going to make it, because you only have a 72-hour window. But they did make it. The team, through sheer willpower, through solutions, collaboration, not taking no for an answer, finding a different avenue, they did it. Once that happened, we developed plans A, B, C, D, and E [for this scenario]. It was week-to-week, day-to-day, hand-to-hand holding to find new routes. In some cases in the US, it was faster for us to use trucks than to fly. We literally had some employees who used to work getting medical supplies into war-torn countries helping us navigate getting our cells to patients.",
            "The hope is that we never go back to prepandemic thinking, that we can continue to keep that patient at the center of everything that we do and say, âThat is whatâs most important.â We actually now map out the entire patient journey and say, âHow do you get the cells faster to a patient?â Weâre now down to only seven days to manufacture, seven days for sterility. Weâre getting them back to patients on average within 16 days in the US.",
            "However, itâs months before they actually get to the point where they do the apheresis in the hospital to get their cells. So weâre saying, âIf weâre a leader, and we want to take the learnings of the pandemic, how do we harness and help and collaborate with the whole healthcare system to cut these months down for the patient to weeks and days just like weâre doing during the manufacturing process?â",
            "  How have advancements in digital and technology that happened during COVID-19 affected Kite?",
            " We have something we call âKite Konnect,â which was first established just to make sure that we could track patientsâ cells from the authorized treatment center to the manufacturing site and back. That digital system has evolved to include servicing patients, having their data, being able to resolve questions, and understanding why there are cancellation rates.",
            "We hope to be able to scale that to lead to better science. To use it not just for treating patients as it was originally designed but to possibly learn, based on all of the data that weâre capturing, why some patients respond and others donât. Could some of the signals that weâre getting from this data feed back into our R&D pipeline to better improve the therapies that weâre delivering? How do we also use it for gathering patient information in an appropriate, compliant manner?",
            "  Last, regarding the pandemic, did it change your ways of working?",
            "Our employees who work with the patient cells were so committed that they kept coming in during the pandemic. In fact, in March of this year in China, there were actually over one hundred manufacturing employees living in the research lab so that they could continue to deliver for patients. We had just launched in China in January. This is our joint venture, Fosun Kite, with Fosun, a pharmaceutical company. Huge demand. At this point in the pandemic in China, if the employees went home, they couldnât come back. So we have pictures of them sleeping on the floor, showering, and living in the lab.",
            "So that part hasnât changed, the commitment to the patients and going to the cell therapy factories every day. What has changed, though, is that many of us outside the labs now work from wherever we are. Weâve learned to be more efficient. Weâre trying to have core days where if people are coming to the office, they know other people will be here.",
            "  Switching tracks a bit, how do you think about globalization in a world where geopolitical complexity is amplifying?",
            " Our goal is that every patient who needs our therapy receives the therapy. So over time, weâve been able to reach new patients, new geographies. On five continents, in 20 countries, we have reimbursement. In fact, most recently we filed regulatory filings for approvals in Brazil, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia. We have already launched in Japan and China. We have commercial partners there, a joint venture in China, and we recently announced that Daiichi Sankyo is transferring the Yescarta marketing authorization in Japan to us.",
            "I canât emphasize enough that thereâs the geographic expansion, but thereâs also the expansion needed in the countries weâre already in. After five years postapproval for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, even today only two out of ten patients who are eligible are actually receiving the therapy. Forty-three percent of patients are alive five years after receiving this therapy, so thatâs a big chance at life that every patient deserves. So geographic is one kind of expansion but also just expanding within the geographies we have is very important. And then the last piece is really expanding the number of indications and the different types of diseases that we treat.",
            "Forty-three percent of patients are alive five years after receiving this therapy, so thatâs a big chance at life that every patient deserves.",
            "  Kite is an innovative organization within a pharmaceutical giant, Gilead. What are the benefits and the challenges of that larger relationship?",
            " Cell therapy is a complex area where investment is required before you see any kind of profitability. Thatâs what Gilead has provided: the investment and support needed to really take such innovation to the masses. Thatâs been a tremendous benefit for us.",
            "A big decision that was made before I got here by the then-new Gilead CEO Dan OâDay was to keep Kite as an independent companyânot isolated from Gileadâbut independent. I think thatâs one of our biggest advantages. Kite is vertically integrated and exclusively focused on cell therapy and the only company thatâs structured this way. Cell therapy requires incredible integration between the various parts of the company. We operate in a team sport environment where our manufacturing, research, clinical development, commercial, medical affairs, and our G&A [general and administrative] functions like legal, HR, finance are all highly integrated to operate as one.",
            "That cross-functional approachâhaving that independenceâhas allowed us to really run fast and scale fast in the last three years. At the same time, we have the luxury of some of the things that we donât need to replicate or duplicate, such as IT infrastructure. The support that we get from Gilead is tremendous.",
            "  You brought up this analogy of team sports, which makes me think about teams, talent, and diversity in the life sciences. You are somewhat unusual, not only as a woman CEO but also because you grew up on an Iowa farm, and youâre the first in your family to go to college. Can you share a bit of your story and also talk about how youâre pursuing diversity company-wide?",
            "I grew up on the farm in Iowa. In the summers, I got up at the crack of dawn. I always had chores and really learned hard work. My dad was in corporate America. He traveled during the week, came home on the weekends. On the other side, my mom was extremely philanthropic, always helping with the neighbors and at church. She also started her own restaurant once my siblings and I were grown.",
            "I was a junior in high school when I learned about this industry. My science teacher had a brother who worked in the industry, and I thought, âWhat a great way to use some of the skills Iâve learnedâprobably received from my father on the business sideâwhile also doing good, learning from what my mom had taught me.â",
            "Now fast-forward to where I am today. We need diversity within Kite so that we can ensure that we donât have blind spots in how we approach the patient journey. Our cell therapy specialists, who are in our labs reengineering patientsâ cells, make up the majority of our employees. They actually are trained by us; it takes six months. So weâve asked, what kind of background do they need to come to Kite? It used to always be a four-year college degree, but we have now actually entered into some community college associate degree programs to help teach cell therapy along the way. We want to help these students become aware of it through training programs while theyâre in school and internships. Itâs been so successful, and it also helps us reach a more diverse population. Weâre actually looking at carrying that into high schools.",
            "Weâre also trying to bring the patient journey every week into the organization. Diverse patients that we treat come and talk to our employees in the cell therapy labs and our offices, and give us their insights.",
            "The third area we look at is our clinical-trial diversity. Our goal is to work with the organizations, academic centers, and treatment centers that are great at making sure that they recruit diverse populations so that we can ensure that we know the results of how our therapy works on different ethnicities.",
            "  In 2016, you put your career on hold and spent a year as a caregiver to your sister, who had multiple myeloma, a cancer that ultimately took her life. How did this experience change you and change the way you lead, if at all, as a CEO?",
            " After caring for my sister in 2016, I had a whole new outlook on what it means to be patient focused. That includes simple things, like the amount of paperwork thatâs placed upon a patient when theyâre at their sickest. And the little things, like when theyâre on so many medications and the color of their pill changes because the pharmacy is buying the medication from a different place.",
            "And then thereâs the point where the doctor walks in the room and gives you the information that he or she thinks you need, and then leaves the room. At that point, my sister said, âI have no idea what he said.â Thatâs an example of a patient not understanding scientific jargon. Itâs very, very difficult.",
            "So, for me, coming back to the industry after that experience has meant a huge focus on patients. In our meetings, we say, âHow does this affect patients?â âHow is this going to help patients?â Or, âIâm glad we fixed our problem. But we didnât fix the patientâs problem.â",
            "It has to be all about that patient journey, not just our sliver of it, not just the pharmaceutical industryâs point of view. My experience has made me understand it has to be about bringing that patient journey lens into focus from end to end.",

        "description": "European health systems used in vitro diagnostic testing in new ways to tackle COVID-19. Now leaders can apply these tactics more broadly.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " that the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed the in vitro diagnostic (IVD) testing",
            " market. Huge investment and rapid innovation across Europe were critical in coping with the considerable demand for testing. ",
            "Health systems have a distinct opportunity to unlock the full potential of testing by identifying where diagnostics can have the greatest positive impact on health outcomes, better embedding data and digital solutions into the testing pathway, and using partnerships and novel delivery models to sustain innovation and improve access to care. IVD testing suppliers and other stakeholders will play an important role in supporting the transition to a new diagnostic testing construct and could start to consider how best to bring innovative technology, services, and partnership models to their customers.",
            "Throughout the pandemic, Europe saw massive investment in IVD testing to scale up capacity, as well as an urgency to innovate quickly to cope with historic demand. The first diagnostic COVID-19 test was developed by researchers in Germany in mid-January 2020,",
            " and the first test with a CE (ConformitÃ© EuropÃ©enne) mark",
            " was launched only one month later for commercial distribution.",
            " For comparison, the typical development timeline is more than four years.",
            " By the end of 2021, nearly 2.9 billion COVID-19 tests had been performed across Europe.",
            "The rapid growth in testing during the pandemic led to innovation across the healthcare services value chain. New testing sites were developed in the community, and many tests were taken at home, signifying a major shift in how many individuals had access to testing. New testing technologies were introduced, such as CRISPR",
            " and rapid breath testers,",
            " in addition to the first at-scale use of sequencing at the point of care.",
            " Health systems enhanced their integration of (and access to) diagnostic data, and public and private organizations collaborated more closely than ever.",
            "Testing for COVID-19 has provided a blueprint for sampling and testing at home that has the potential to enable wider screening for (and monitoring of) chronic diseases. Recently, for example, pharmaceutical companies have worked to produce self-administered blood tests to test for chronic kidney disease and heart failure.",
            " COVID-19 testing has also demonstrated the potential value of other testing use cases, such as population-level screening to understand the evolution of infectious disease. Last, the experience of IVD testing for COVID-19 has shifted the mindset of physicians and patients about the purpose of testing from solely the diagnosis and stratification of illness to the confirmation of wellness.",
            "Navigating the pandemic has caused many health systems to ask the same question: âHow do we build from this experience?â",
            "A broader testing transformation faces many hurdles. Health systems are confronting persistent workforce shortages and substantial financial pressure exacerbated by the pandemic and inflation.",
            " For example, 90 percent of hospitals in the Netherlands are at risk of recording losses in 2023.",
            " In addition, competing issues, such as the care backlog, may take priority over a long-term diagnostics redesign. The established prepandemic approach to testing is also deeply entrenched in health systems, making any large-scale changes even more daunting.",
            "Alternatively, many health systems may take the view that, given the severity and urgency of COVID-19, the approach to IVD testing during the pandemic was necessary at the time but need not be expanded to other use cases. Although there is some variation among healthcare systems in Europe in testing practices and requirements, the levels of spending by governments on IVD testing during the pandemic far exceeded historic spend. In the United Kingdom, for instance, NHS Test and Trace (NHST&T) spent Â£10.4 billion on IVD testing in 2020 and 2021,",
            " substantially exceeding previous levels: in 2017, for example, NHS IVD testing spend was an estimated Â£850 million.",
            " Denmark, meanwhile, spent 0.5 percent of its GDP on testing in 2021.",
            " ",
            "By rethinking the testing model in its entirety and applying many of the lessons learned through the pandemic, health systems could increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and affordability of IVD testing and alleviate many of the stresses they are experiencing today.",
            "Health systems have a window of opportunity to align their strategic aspirations with the changing needs and expectations of clinicians and patients. In parallel, they could establish an operating model that embeds these changes for the coming decades and creates more use cases for diagnostic testing. Below, we outline five main priorities healthcare leaders can consider to achieve this broader goal.",
            "As demand for COVID-19 testing decreases, health leaders could repurpose existing testing capacity to address key priorities in healthcare and improve patient outcomes. At the same time, when responding to demand, it will be crucial to use the lessons learned from the pandemic and flex resources (including facilities that have been shut down since pandemic demand receded) up or down to ensure sufficient capacity within the overall system",
            "Understanding where IVD testing can drive the most value for health systems is vital for maximizing the use of existing facilities. Identifying local health priorities will be necessary to determine how different technologies could best be redeployed. These goals could be accomplished in three main ways: ",
            "Research has suggested that two-thirds of the health improvement opportunity in Europe lies in disease prevention and earlier intervention. As such, improved access to diagnostics plays a crucial role in improving health outcomes and economic prosperity in the region.",
            "For example, a potential focus in many systems may be ischemic heart disease, which is the number-one cause of death in every European country apart from North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Portugal.",
            " Early diagnosis and treatment of often asymptomatic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, which predispose individuals to ischemic heart disease, can have a meaningful, long-term impact on population health outcomes.",
            "Alternatively, widespread biomarker analyses in areas such as oncology and immunology could enable risk stratification and the development of personalized treatment plans. These approaches are used to inform the treatment of lung cancer, a top five killer in every European country other than Portugal and Moldova. In Austria, for example, allele-specific PCR",
            " or next-generation sequencing is recommended to test for key lung cancer markers. ",
            "Finally, identifying and tracing infectious diseases, such as respiratory and sexually transmitted infections, within a population could help leaders to better plan and target public health responses through tailored educational or immunization campaigns. ",
            " These decision makers can assess current infrastructure and ensure a balance between national strategic aims and local testing needs. Engaging primary care leaders will become increasingly important in understanding specific testing requirements as well as the optimal modalities of testing delivery to address unmet needs within a local population. In turn, frontline clinicians in these settings of care could identify disease earlier and with greater precision to intervene appropriately.",
            "For example, primary-care leaders could initiate programs to screen for and identify diseases that disproportionately affect specific groups, such as cardiovascular disease in South Asian communities within European countries.",
            " This approach focuses on the leading driver of disease burden while targeting interventions on higher-risk groups in the population, thereby optimizing investment.",
            "Testing modalities carry different advantages and disadvantages, which must be considered when addressing public health priorities. Modalities can be deployed in different ways depending on specific population health needs within a community and can be rapidly adjusted to address emerging healthcare challenges, such as disease outbreaks. For example, to guide oncology treatments, nanopore sequencing could be used to identify key mutations in tumors and would allow the detection of rare but clinically significant mutations. The same technology could also be deployed to detect infectious disease. Compared to traditional nucleic acid testing, the speed and portability of nanopore sequencing could assist in rapidly mapping outbreaks and help health systems proactively recognize and manage public health threats. ",
            "Easy access to testing was commonplace during the pandemic. Near-patient and at-home sampling and testing could have much broader applications beyond COVID-19, improving access and turnaround times. For example, in the United Kingdom, about 90 percent of results processed through NHST&T were reported within 72 hours, and patients had direct access to results. Maintaining improved access to diagnostic testing could also have a profound impact on reducing morbidity and health inequities. It would involve two main steps.",
            "First, health systems would need to design an integrated ecosystem of point-of-care technologies that overcomes the logistical complexity of decentralized testing to ensure that patient care history is uninterrupted. For instance, whether a prescribed test is taken in a primary-care facility, in a pharmacy, or at home, a standardized system would be required for different stakeholders to access results regardless of which approach was used.",
            "Second, health systems would need to identify the disease areas and patient groups that would benefit most from improved access to testing. Then they could provide more equitable care access and address health inequities by developing specific programs for underrepresented groups that have historically not engaged with health systems. For example, they could perform localized population screening in high-risk groups, as has proven successful for Q fever within high-risk groups in the Netherlands.",
            "Physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic made it necessary for health systems to look for new ways to reach people quickly, leading to swift and substantial innovation across the value chain, including the use of new assay types, telemedicine, test-result apps, and at-home testing-kit delivery. Although the pandemic has subsided, health systems could continue to prioritize innovation to benefit both patients and physicians and to help address persistent challenges, such as a pathology workforce shortage.",
            " Three opportunities are particularly relevant to health systems following the many lessons learned during the pandemic. They can be most adequately addressed through both digital and service improvements.",
            "First, health systems could deploy new diagnostic modalities (LAMP",
            " and long-read sequencing,",
            " for example) and previously underused diagnostic modalities, such as endpoint PCR testing. During the pandemic, these testing methods had an important complementary role to real-time PCR tests, typically enabling higher volumes, faster turnaround times, and improved access. These methods could also be employed in situations not related to COVID-19: LAMP, for instance, could be used for near-patient molecular testing for influenza. ",
            "Second, along with new diagnostic testing options, digital technologies were also crucial for healthcare delivery throughout the pandemic, with ",
            " scaling substantially.",
            " Health systems could continue to evolve their thinking on how the diagnostic workflow can be digitalized to help them more effectively share data and improve clinical decision making as patients travel among care delivery organizations (from primary to secondary to tertiary care, for instance).",
            "Third, delivering new diagnostic tests and digital solutions will require models of service to evolve beyond those developed during COVID-19 testing. This continued evolution of service models could help increase the efficiency and efficacy of IVD testing for patients by reducing barriers to access, such as long waiting times to access primary care. ",
            "Many health systems saw a step change in their ability to report data because of increased coordination and sharing of testing data. These data helped improve the robustness of testing systems and informed strategic decision making. For example, in the United Kingdom, the availability of daily testing data at the local-authority level informed the deployment of mobile testing units in places such as Blackburn.",
            " ",
            "Going forward, to increase patientsâ engagement with their own health, health systems could empower patients to take ownership of their healthcare data by making it available through apps or other digital tools. Systems could use those data to ensure that services address specific patient requirements and drive higher standards. For example, some leading imaging companies have created platforms that integrate data (including imaging data) to rapidly generate patient-specific insights.",
            " These platforms enable healthcare systems to build their own apps or use third-party apps that can work directly within the platform to allow patients and healthcare clinicians to monitor health statuses. Health systems could couple IVD testing with similar platforms to better monitor patient health.",
            "Through patient interactions with these apps and digital tools, health systems could also capture and integrate patient-reported outcomes to produce distinctive data sets that could inform better diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient management for chronic diseases such as diabetes. Furthermore, data could be leveraged to improve healthcare research and clinical decision making, which would, in turn, allow for a deeper understanding of diseases at both the patient and the population level. ",
            "Finally, health systems could embed real-time data into strategic planning and drive operational improvement across regional and national networks.

        "paragraphs": [
            " faces saturated retail locations, ongoing labor shortages, inflationary pressure, and a leveling-off of generic drug penetration. To effectively compete in this environment, all types of retail pharmacies can strive to better understand and adapt to changing consumer preferences. McKinsey conducted a consumer survey of more than 1,000 people in the United States to gain insight into these preferences.",
            " This article lays out how the retail pharmacy landscape has changed over the years, how consumer preferences have evolved, and how different types of retail pharmacies may respond as a result.",
            "This article is a collaborative effort by Alok Ladsariya, Alec McLeod, Garam Noh, ",
            ", and BJ Tevelow, representing views from McKinseyâs Healthcare Practice.",
            "Over the past two decades, the retail pharmacy landscapeâdefined as pharmacies that dispense prescription medicationâhas evolved substantially. We break down the sector into four types of retail pharmacies: retail chains, regional pharmacies such as mass retail and grocers, independent pharmacies, and mail-order and online pharmacies (Exhibit 1).",
            "Retail chains are the largest and most prevalent of the four pharmacy types, representing a third of stores and about a third of prescription revenues in 2021. On a per-store basis, retail chains dispense approximately 138,000 prescriptions annuallyâabout 50 percent more than grocers, the next largest prescription dispensers per retail location.",
            " Industry consolidation and gains in efficiency through economies of scale help account for this difference. For example, from 2010 to 2021, CVS and Walgreens acquired a total of nearly 5,000 pharmacy locations, including CVS acquisitions of 1,700 Target pharmacies and Walgreens acquisitions of 1,900 Rite Aid pharmacies.",
            " However, the consolidation wave may have already peaked; these organizations are now shifting their focus to improving operating margins. To that end, the companies have announced plans to reduce their footprint. For example, in 2019, Walgreens said it would close 200 US stores; in late 2021, CVS announced that it would âreduce store density in certain locationsâ and close 900 stores by 2024.",
            " As part of this strategic shift, national chains have also begun to explore growth opportunities in adjacencies such as healthcare services, primary care, and vaccinations.",
            "The evolution of national chains has, in turn, put pressure on other retail pharmacy types such as regional pharmacies. This group can be further segmented into two types: grocers (supermarkets that also have a pharmacy) and mass retail (large consumer goods retailers that also have a pharmacy). In 2021, regional pharmacies represented around 30 percent of stores and 15 percent of prescription revenue.",
            " On a per-store basis, mass retail and grocers fill 91,000 prescriptions per pharmacy per year on average.",
            "Grocers have experienced variable performance over the past few years. Larger grocers have grown through acquisition, and smaller ones have increasingly been acquired by national chains or larger grocers. For mass retail pharmacies, economies of scale based on brand name and size have enabled them to negotiate incentive-based networks and narrow networks with health plans, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), and independent employers, increasing traffic to their stores.",
            "In contrast to the growth in national chains, the number of independent pharmacies has decreased by nearly 50 percent since 1980, leveling off at about 20,000 locations since 2000.",
            " Independent pharmacies fill about 48,000 prescriptions per pharmacy per year.",
            " Those that remain have stayed viable through effective collaboration with other independents and wholesalers. This cooperation has taken the form of administrative, operational, and other business management support from wholesalers, pharmacy service administrative organizations, and group-purchasing organizations.",
            "For the fourth type of retail pharmacy, mail-order and online pharmacies, overall penetration for nonspecialty drugs is low compared with penetration for specialty drugs. In 2021, these organizations accounted for less than 10 percent of total US prescriptions,",
            " but they are gaining traction. Historically, mail-order pharmacies were defined as PBM-owned processing facilities that filled maintenance medications centrally. In the past 15 years, a number of direct-to-consumer online pharmacies unaffiliated with PBMs have been established, with this segment receiving more than $3 billion in funding to date.",
            " In parallel, traditional players such as retail chains have also moved to more omnichannelâphysical, online, and mailâoptions. For example, Walgreens has its own mail-order pharmacy, offers same-day delivery from 8,000 stores, and provides prescription fulfillment through its phone app.",
            "In this evolving environment, retail pharmacies can work to ensure they understand and meet consumersâ needs so they are a preferred destination. The McKinsey survey of more than 1,000 US consumers can help us understand current consumer needs and what may be changing. Four key insights emerged (Table 1).",
            "In this evolving environment, retail pharmacies can work to ensure they understand and meet consumersâ needs so they are a preferred destination.",
            "More than two-thirds of survey respondents report satisfaction with their primary retail pharmacy and would recommend it to a friend or colleague. Respondents selected insurance coverage and proximity to home as the top two criteria when selecting a retail pharmacy (Exhibit 2). At the same time, nearly a third of respondents have switched their preferred retail pharmacy in the past five years for one of two reasons: changing insurance coverage or a changing place of residence.",
            "According to the survey, retail chains remain the most popular type of primary retail pharmacy, with 47 percent of respondents selecting it. However, the likelihood of respondents reporting a retail chain as their primary pharmacy decreased as the number of monthly medications increased (Exhibit 3).",
            "Despite longstanding PBM mail-order, local-delivery, and (more recently) online options, these alternatives to visiting a brick-and-mortar pharmacy to pick up prescriptions still have relatively low market penetration. Forty-five percent of respondents have never used a mail-order or online pharmacy, and only 13 percent consider a mail-order or online pharmacy to be their primary pharmacy. However, the survey results suggest growing awareness and acceptance of these alternative channels. Forty-four percent of consumers who use a mail-order or home delivery service reported choosing these services over other delivery options more often than they did two or three years ago. Among respondents who are not currently using these services but are willing to consider switching, convenience and price are reported as the top motivating factors.",
            "Consumers of all backgrounds appear to welcome all types of retail pharmacies taking on a broader role that encompasses more than prescription dispensing, a trend that is reflected in their spending patterns. At their primary retail pharmacies, consumers reported purchasing a variety of non-prescription-medication products beyond over-the-counter products (48 percent), including food and grocery (36 percent), beauty products (32 percent), and household items (30 percent). Consumers also said they were interested in accessing a broader range of healthcare service offerings in their retail pharmacies, with about four in ten expressing interest in common-illness treatment, whole-health fusion,",
            " and other health services, including primary care, dental, lab work, and X-rays.",
            "At its most basic level, drug dispensingâfilling a prescription accurately and on timeâcould be considered a commodity service. But given evolving consumer preferences, each type of pharmacyâretail chains, regional pharmacies such as mass retail and grocers, independent pharmacies, and mail-order and online pharmaciesâcan seek to meet these needs through different methods. Long-term success can be achieved in one of two ways: creating a differentiated experience for the consumer or offering a differentiated set of products and services. This section explores some key questions and opportunities tailored to the unique strengths of each type of retail pharmacy (Table 2).",
            "Retail chains can consider creating more-personalized experiences to attract high-touch consumers with whom independent pharmacies have traditionally held an advantage. Additionally, retail chains can consider new ways to use their scale to offer a differentiated set of services. Two opportunitiesâomnichannel engagement and healthcare servicesâshow particular promise.",
            "First, as behavior changes sparked by COVID-19 continue beyond the pandemic, consumers will continue to demand digital and omnichannel solutions that allow them to receive pharmacy care when and where they need it most (for example, home delivery, same-day delivery, and on-demand pharmacist support). Retail chains, given their geographical reach and ability to invest in these capabilities, are well positioned to satisfy this demand.",
            "Second, retail chains can best respond to consumer interest in accessing a broad set of healthcare services in the retail pharmacy setting. Retail chains have the balance sheet to build in-house capabilities (for example, to provide primary care and treat common illnesses) or forge at-scale partnerships with external vendors to provide those services.",
            "Regional pharmacies such as mass retail and grocers can consider ways to differentiate themselves based on another factor: integration into daily life. Because they are already embedded into the flow of consumersâ daily lives, these pharmacies can seek to satisfy consumer wellness needs (for example, for healthy foods and over-the-counter supplements) in an integrated way with pharmacy services.",
            "More specifically, mass retail and grocers could be well positioned to become a one-stop shop for all things related to health, creating front- and back-of-store synergies for certain treatment categories. For example, a diabetic consumer may need a full spectrum of products, including prescription drugs, a tailored diet, glucose meters, glucose test strips, eye vitamins, dry-mouth treatments, and skin care products. The mass retail or grocer that can seamlessly fulfill these needs in one location could deliver outsize value to the consumer.",
            "In contrast to the national chains and regional pharmacies, independent pharmacies can bolster their position by further personalizing care, especially for high-touch consumers. They can consider, for example, approaches to satisfy the particular needs of patients with complex chronic conditions or deepen the relationship between pharmacist and patient with personalized services.",
            "While their smaller scale may have traditionally been seen as a challenge, independent pharmacies can also consider satisfying unmet needs in rural or other areas where there is lower penetration by national chains.",
            "Online pharmacies seeking to disrupt the market can pursue strategies that reinforce their natural benefits (speed and convenience) with their corresponding target demographic (convenience seekers). But they can also work to bridge some of the potential gaps in consumer experience caused by their lower-touch approach. Mail-order and online pharmacies may consider ways to create a more personalized experience that preserves some of the benefits of an in-person experience. For example, video telehealth visits with remote pharmacists could help establish a personal connection to complement the benefits of convenience in the absence of face-to-face consultations.",
            "As the retail pharmacy landscape evolves, different types of pharmacies must seek new ways to meet consumer needs to remain differentiated and relevant. While certain overall trends, including the demand for convenience and the benefits of personalization, are relevant to all types of retail pharmacies, the specific strategy to become a âpharmacy of the futureâ will vary for each type. There is no one-size-fits-all approach.",

            "affects fewer than one in 6,000 newborn males every year.",
            " This rare genetic disorder is characterized by a progressive muscle breakdown, starting with those closest to the bodyâs core and moving to affect the extremities.",
            " Historically, the life expectancy of DMD carriers barely stretched beyond the teen years. New drug therapies, however, have extended that life span well into a patientâs 40s or 50s by slowing muscular degeneration and improving cardiac and lung function. For the small group of people affected by this disease, that development brings hope and the potential to improve their quality of life immensely.",
            "DMD drug therapy is just one example of the advances being made in the fight against rare diseases. Since Congress passed the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 in the United States, momentum has picked up rapidly. In particular, in the past decade, some large pharmaceutical companies have refocused their portfolios to include therapies catered to treating these conditions, and others have focused on creating more solutions within their established rare disease portfolios. The past few years have also seen a discernible spike in mergers and acquisitions in this area. In 2021 alone, three deals of more than $10 billion were announced or completed. ",
            "These advancements are largely thanks to breakthroughs in technologyâin particular, growing sophistication in the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence. Such advances have improved diagnostics, boosted research and development, and enabled patient identification and the tracking of disease progression. As a result, the rare disease industry is now on the brink of maturity and prepared for a period of sustained growth. ",
            "However, several important hurdles remain. Notably, the inherently small sample size of patients who suffer from rare diseases is a shift from the broader patient segments for which treatments were historically created. Developing treatments for this population requires a greater degree of personalization. Companies that can address these scaling challenges and land on the cutting edge of new medicines and technologies could be part of an attractive market. In fact, the market for rare disease therapies is expected to grow 11 percent per year,",
            " with about $131 billion in revenue expected in 2026.",
            " For patients who have not had access to or even the option of receiving a solution for their condition, new therapies offer a great amount of hope and relief.",
            "Novel cell and gene therapies add a new class of transformative therapies to the clinical aperture and often come with a curative promise for patients. Despite the complexity of this industryâand in some cases, because of itâthe market can be an attractive investment for pharmaceutical companies. ",
            "First, many rare diseases are characterized by a high, unmet need with limited or no approved therapies available. Of the few rare diseases that do have therapies available, two-thirds have only one or two products.",
            " This gap in the market may offer companies a chance to break into the space, but the thousands of diseases without existing treatments offer an even greater opportunity to address patient needs. Second, the etiology of many rare diseases can be addressed by novel cell and gene therapy technologies and the potentially curative innovation they can support. Today, many of the FDA-approved cell and gene therapies are approved for rare diseases. Third, rare disease therapies perform better in progressing through clinical developments. Between 2006 and 2015, the chance of a rare disease drug moving from Phase I to approval was about 2.6 times higher than the overall approval rate for drug compounds (about 10 percent).",
            " Last, rare disease drugs benefit from dedicated incentives from regulators, governments, and reimbursement authorities across markets, such as orphan status, orphan-drug exclusivity, and rare disease frameworks. These incentives help sponsor the development and commercialization of drugs for smaller patient populations, which might not be economically attractive otherwise.",
            "New technological advances, catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, have required companies to rethink their approach to launching rare-disease treatments, particularly in how they leverage digital and analytics capabilities to create patient-centric solutions. Companies have learned how to use these new tools to make advances in research and development, patient segmentation, healthcare provider (HCP) engagement, and disease evolution tracking. As outlined in a previous article,",
            " developing a patient-centric approach is critical to successfully launch a new rare disease therapy. Advances in digital technologies have rapidly evolved over recent years and broadened the aperture of how pharmaceutical companies can build patient-centric approaches. ",
            "The sections below showcase how technology has transformed how rare disease companies engage their ecosystem and how leaders have leveraged new tools to innovate further. ",
            "Compared with other disease areas, the rare disease space is often characterized by close connections within the community of patients, caregivers, and patient associations. Each member of the rare disease community plays a central role because of the often low awareness of these conditions and the high degree of disease complexity and comorbidities. Companies can play an integral role in the community and improve patient outcomes by better understanding pain points along the entire patient journey and continuously innovating to uncover and address unmet needs. To do this successfully, companies need to work closely with HCPs to build a better understanding of the disease and the therapies available. ",
            "Companies are making great strides using digital and analytics to improve their engagement models with both HCPs and rare disease patients. Companies are now able to efficiently navigate extensive data sets to precisely engage relevant HCPs within a narrow disease area focus and accurately tailor content, channels, and timing. Engaging HCPs when it matters most and ensuring end-to-end personalized experiences that are tailored to the niche needs of both prescribers and payers facilitates greater and more-effective HCP engagement. With the right information at the right time, HCPs can greatly improve the standard of care for their patients.",
            "For example, one rare-disease-focused pharmaceutical company used its HCP segmentation and call plan design to carry out a highly successful launch, with above-average uptake. The company built a data-driven predictive physician engagement model, drawing on insights and data from several years of physician engagement and subspecialty-specific clinical practice patterns. Using machine learning, the company developed a dynamic call plan that flexibly defined when and how often to engage each physician for optimal field resource deployment. At the same time, this approach reprioritized the engagement for more than 30 percent of HCPs. As a result, HCPs were being engaged when it was most relevant for them (around the timing of seeing a predicted patient) and in a manner that was genuinely relevant to their needs.",
            "In addition to being well connected to patient groups, companies also need to identify a fully representative set of the whole disease population. By leveraging advanced analytics, machine learning, and other tools, companies can develop a greater understanding of unmet medical needs. Education about the disease and the treatment journey can then be focused on specific regions or healthcare systems with the highest needs. And engagement models can include specialized peer-to-peer education sessions or well-structured testing programs, such as family testing, to identify potential disease markers.",
            "It can take several years for patients to be diagnosed with a rare disease, and in that time, symptoms often worsen significantly. Recent advances in analytics, coupled with greater accessibility of large data sets, give pharmaceutical companies an opportunity to identify and spotlight patient groups more quickly.",
            "For example, one global pharmaceutical company with a sizable rare disease operation deployed digital and analytics to improve its patient-finding approach for one of its rare-disease treatments. Using multiple core data sets of potential patients, the company built a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of any given individual having the targeted rare disease. The company then used this model to identify a large population of undiagnosed patients and the physicians who were disproportionately likely to oversee patients with the disease. This more precise engagement of physicians enabled an increase of more than 40 percent in the number of patients who could benefit from earlier and better access to diagnosis and care in the five years following treatment launch.",
            "Companies that take advantage of early-access programs can bolster the existence and quality of their distribution channels, create better opportunities to close funding gaps, and build partnerships with third-party institutions.",
            "Real-world evidence (RWE) has been used extensively across the value chain to understand how rare diseases can present, manifest, and be treated. To date, most value created throughout the disease ecosystemâbetter treatments for patients, better economics for pharmaceutical companies, and more transparency for payers and public stakeholdersâhas been after approval, and the full potential of RWE in the research and development phase has not yet been realized. A wealth of new data and analytics approaches using RWE can now be applied during R&D phases, and regulators are increasingly willing to adopt these approaches. For example, companies can use this data to monitor medicines, assess emerging health threats, and inform regulatory decision making. Many companies have invested in analytics pilots in R&D, but most have not yet built at-scale capabilities.",
            "For example, a global pharmaceutical company in late-stage development of a new therapy recently targeted a pathway implicated in pathogenesis of a rare disease with no approved treatments. Due to small patient numbers, conventional techniques failed to establish causal relationships between the disease and life-threatening outcomes. To support the launch of this new therapy, the company aimed to better characterize the disease burden and clinical outcomes by bringing new and more-convincing evidence to regulators, payers, and physicians. The company applied data engineering and clinical definitions to a large data set of electronic medical records (EMR) to identify patients with the condition. Based on the work with the data set, the company used novel machine learning to assess causal relationships between the rare disease and life-threatening outcomes and mortality. It was then able to expand the patient cohort addressed by clinical studies and received regulatory approval for the product launch.",
            "Rare disease patients and their caregivers typically require education and social support after diagnosis. Subject to local regulatory conditions, support can be provided by specialist nursing services and bolstered by help lines. Pharmaceutical companies can also provide or fund support servicesâeither directly or through a third-party providerâand can learn how patients experience their treatments in real time.",
            "Digital health platforms can be an effective avenue to support patients and caregivers throughout the patient journey. Starting with diagnostic and disease education, innovative solutions such as AI-enabled symptom checkers are emerging. An increasing number of solutions are also appearing in digital therapeutics and treatment support, including remote monitoring and app-powered support for treatment adherence. One treatment for a chronic rare disease, for example, leverages a mobile app for symptom tracking and personalized dosing recommendations, allowing patients to share their data with their healthcare provider for an optimized treatment algorithm. ",
            "Additionally, players such as pharmacies and patient advocacy groups are strengthening their online presence, further improving patient reach and convenience. For instance, one pharmaceutical company developed a mobile app that allows hemophilia patients to monitor and track their disease in connection with their healthcare providers. The provider defines personalized patient settings to curate a custom treatment regimen, including dosing, infusion schedules, and follow-up visits. Patients can use the app to track their symptoms and help plan lifestyle activities based on current and estimated disease markers, meaningfully improving therapy adherence. In turn, providers can further refine the patientâs care plan. Through an individualized treatment plan and constant support, patients can manage their disease and reach treatment goals.",
            "As companies focus on the market for rare disease therapies, they must overcome several challenges. First and foremost, addressing the scale of unmet needs is a daunting prospect, as is finding and diagnosing patients. Given that these diseases are characterized by comparatively low levels of awareness and knowledge, many patients remain undiagnosed for years. When they are diagnosed, the small sample size of these populations makes it difficult for life sciences companies to test and deliver their drugs across a wide range of patients and for health systems to learn how to properly treat these populations. ",
            "In the United Kingdom, for example, one pharmaceutical company partnered with patient advocacy groups and a clinical research organization to understand the needs of patients with Huntingtonâs disease and delivered the results to care centers within the National Health Service (NHS) to help providers understand what âgood careâ looks like for someone with this condition. Properly serving patients with other atypical diagnoses would require that same level of attention and research.",
            "Another challenge is that treatment regimens for rare diseases typically impose high burdens on patients, such as requiring them to make appointments for frequent infusions and travel to faraway treatment sites. On top of everything else, the diseases themselves often present with significant comorbidities. But life sciences companies still have a significant opportunity to have a dramatic positive impact on patientsâ lives by creating patient-centric experiences and life-changing therapies.",
            "The next wave of innovation and growth is expected to change care and access for many patients with high, unmet needs. To bring innovative therapies to patients with rare diseases, companies need to evolve their capabilities into a patient-centric model, closely working with stakeholders across the treatment continuum while embracing the power of digital and analytics to identify eligible patients and tailor offerings and services to their needs.",
            "Leading-edge innovators in the rare disease industry are increasingly embarking on digital transformations to identify product-specific opportunities and build a differentiated experience for patients and providers. A successful digital transformation requires players to develop powerful use cases and define a clear road map to implement new technologies, capabilities, and strategies. One potential use case could be using advanced analytics to identify the greatest unmet needs and the patients who are experiencing them. Another could be the launch of a digital app to help patients, providers, and caregivers manage a disease more effectively. ",
            "Digital and analytics transformations in rare diseases can help companies identify undiagnosed patients, create best-in-class patient experiences, and educate healthcare providers where appropriate. These transformations are a critical next step in developing cutting-edge strategies for rare disease patients and specialists. Innovative companies are poised to deliver holistic impact to patients when they combine a foundation of robust core technologies, a bespoke operating model, and international expansion capabilities, along with the right skill set and talent capabilities.",

            "Itâs an enormous system that today weâre looking to transform, and I donât think people fully appreciate just how big a job thatâs going to be.",
            " Iâd say there are three key elements. First is size. I think people donât fully appreciate the magnitude of todayâs existing energy system. On the oil demand side, there are about a hundred million barrels of oil a day. If you convert gas to equivalent barrels a day, itâs 70 million barrels, so 170 million barrels a day of demand. Itâs hard to get your mind around just how big that is. Itâs an enormous system that today weâre looking to transform, and I donât think people fully appreciate just how big a job thatâs going to be.",
            "The second is the critical role [the energy system] plays in supporting economic growth and peopleâs living standards. There are still almost a billion people living in energy poverty. Third, the vital role oil and gas play in the energy system because of their characteristics: energy dense, transportable, extremely available. That brings a level of convenience, reliability, and affordability that is hard to replace.",
            "So when you think about an energy transition and replacing the size, the utility, the need, and then the effectiveness of todayâs energy system with something new, it is challenging. Given the size and the complexity, it will be a transition that has to be managed thoughtfully and carefully over many decades. For every barrel or ton of natural gas we produce, weâve got to find a new replacement to maintain the level of supply and, at the same time, make the investments to transition. Striking a balance between continuing to do what the world needs with todayâs energy system, while working to develop the technologies and drive down the cost of transitioning to a lower-emissions energy system, is critical.",
            " What is the right problem statement to address climate change and energy security?",
            "One of the difficulties in solving the challenges of climate change and energy transition ",
            " the problem statement. There is a cost associated with todayâs energy system, which is the emissions and the impact it has on climate. Thatâs real, thatâs true, and we need to deal with that cost. But that view ignores the benefits it brings to society. And weâve seen, over the last several years, that when those benefits disappearâthink of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, when Europe lost natural gasâthose economies and countries quickly convert back to burning coal for power generation.",
            "Some define the issue as, âWe need to get rid of oil and gas.â The issue needs to be defined as, âWe need to address the emissions associated with the combustion of oil and gas.â In many cases, that will mean you stop burning oil and gas and you have an alternative. Thatâs where wind and solar will play a role and electric vehicles will play a role. Those are necessary solutions, but theyâre not sufficient. So I think the problem statement should be: reduce the emissions, find the technology to do that, and find technology thatâs affordable to effectively implement solutions. We havenât spent enough time as a society working on that piece of the equation.",
            "Whatâs the conversion challenge? ",
            "The big challenge with converting todayâs system to a new system is the cost. To get the cost down with the alternatives available today, youâre going to need technology breakthroughs. The solutions we have today are too expensive, and they themselves may have issues that bring an additional or different cost to the equation. So technology breakthroughs will be critical to bring down the cost and to make sure that alternatives are broadly available and reliably available and affordable. Thatâs number one.",
            "Number two is weâve got to develop an economy that pays for carbon reduction. Eventually, there must be a market where consumers and companies are willing to pay some level of premium to reduce carbon. Because today, thereâs no incentive to justify the investments that, frankly, private companies in just about every sector will have to make. With time, and hopefully as technology costs come down, there will need to be what I refer to as a âcarbon market,â where society pays for carbon reductions, which will then incentivize the investments required to reduce that carbon. The third critical element will be policy. Governments can play a role in catalyzing private industries today to start those investments, to start down the learning curve, to drive technology investments. That policy needs to be transparent, stable, and temporary. Because the worldâs governments cannot afford to pay for this in the absence of the technology development and carbon markets developing. But itâs critical to get things started.",
            "Where does ExxonMobil fit in that equation?",
            "Many people are looking at going into new and different businesses in response to the challenges of climate change and the transition. Our view was that we bring a unique set of skills and capabilities to the world that weâve developed over the last 140 years. And itâs generally focused on transforming molecules: hydrogen and carbon molecules. And what are our skill sets? What are the technology areas that we have expertise in that will be needed? Weâre focused on carbon capture and storage, hydrogen production, and biofuels, which will be needed solutions and part of the equation going forward. Our job in that space is to leverage our capabilities, continue to evolve that technology, drive down those costs, and then build up those businesses at scale.",
            "The other advantage is that we start up brand-new value chains and businesses in countries all around the world. We have the capability to work with governments, communities, and stakeholders to build businesses from scratch. And, frankly, in the carbon reduction business, we need to do the same thing. So that skill set weâve developed in our traditional businesses lends itself to application in the low-carbon businesses.",
            " Can you give an example where a core strength can be applied to such a new business?",
            " Think carbon capture and storage. It requires storing CO",
            " underground. Our subsurface skill setâour ability to model reservoirs, to inject CO",
            "underground, and to drill the wellsâis applicable in our traditional businesses and has an important role to play in carbon capture and storage or in building projects at scale. The size of the investments required and the technology in those investments are all part of our wheelhouse. When you think about our traditional businesses in terms of the molecules weâre managing, and then think about the transition and the business associated there, they both involve hydrogen and carbon molecules.",
            "What is the vision for your Low Carbon Solutions business? ",
            " Itâs in areas that we have these core capabilities. The challenge is getting the cost down. So weâre doing a lot of work in the [technology] space and, frankly, building a brand-new business. We have the worldâs largest commercial contracts to manage customer CO",
            " emissions and to transport those and sequester them safely.",
            "Thatâs an important business we will grow. We, as a company, have captured more anthropogenic CO",
            " than any other company in the world. Weâve got a lot of experience in this space. Weâve used it in a different application. Weâre now using it to store CO",
            ", and weâve got to find ways to get the cost down. I think biofuels will be another important area where we can contribute. Weâve got in-ground facilities that we can convert to use in the biofuels space, which will be a critical part of the equation as well. And hydrogen is the third area that will be critical to a lower-emissions future.",
            "Weâve got a lot of experience in hydrogen. We use it in just about every one of our facilities, so we know what it takes to run a hydrogen business. In fact, weâve got a project to build the largest hydrogen plant in the world. Weâve got the aperture wide open around what the opportunity could be. And the only criterion weâre using is that it fits well with our core capabilities so we can drive an advantage and deliver returns that are above industry average. If we canât do that, our view is we shouldnât be in those businesses.",
            "Other than that, weâre open minded. If we can find a way to reduce the cost of making carbon fiber, we could find ourselves in the building materials business. We recently bought a small company that has a proprietary technology to transform a derivative of gasoline molecules into products that replace steel. So today, we are making a product that can replace rebar in construction.",
            "Youâre confident you can build these businesses and meet the pledge to deliver above-average returns?",
            "The challenge Iâve given the organization is if we have true competitive advantage to bring to bear in the energy transition space, whatever the mechanism is to incentivize investment will, at a minimum, have to be geared to the average, if not the least-efficient, highest-cost tier needed to address abatement. If itâs the average or the highest-cost player that youâre trying to incentivize, our advantages will take us well beyond that, so we should be able to deliver industry-leading returns. We are testing that today. And we are finding that the advantages we bring, compared to others that are in this field, do indeed generate above-industry-average returns and are competitive in our portfolio of investment opportunities. We think we can start these new businesses and develop attractive projects that generate competitive returns, and weâre finding that [to be true] in the early days.",
            " Your business has long investment cycles, and thereâs a lot of uncertainty around policy and technology. How do you decide to deploy capital?",
            " In running this business, we must take a long-term view and then manage the business so itâs robust in the face of the severe commodity cycles weâve historically experienced. When we think about the transition and going forward, the big challenge is exactly what would be the form of that transition? What will be the path taken? How will it evolve? Thereâs a lot of uncertainty associated with that. In this case, the fundamentals we use in our traditional businesses are consistent with the fundamentals weâll use in the new business. Itâs about allocating resources from one sector to another. And that, in my mind, is the challenge for ExxonMobil. In managing the transition, itâs not about starting something brand new, with new capabilities; itâs about how you shift resources appropriately. Thatâs a huge advantage compared to companies that must build, from scratch, brand-new capabilities and businesses. ",
            "Youâve reorganized and changed your operating model to improve returns. What was your thinking there?",
            "We have a long track record of leaning on our core capabilities to drive results and to deliver industry-leading performance. Weâve worked over the last six years to concentrate our efforts in this space and more effectively bring our advantages to bear to deliver industry-leading results. And we can see the impact on our ability to deliver. Itâs also a big motivator for the organization to see that we have capabilities today and competitive advantages in areas that are critically needed to manage the transition.",
            "Historically, weâve had advantages with size, our global footprint, our total scale. We have a portfolio of integrated businesses. Weâve had a technology organization that weâve historically invested about a billion dollars a year in, so weâve always understood the fundamental role technology plays and invested in that capability.",
            "Weâve concentrated on what we refer to as âfunctional excellence,â or think about it as âexecution excellenceâ: making sure that at the end of the day, we execute very, very well in the commodity business. And then weâve always invested heavily in our people and developing those resources. Weâve asked ourselves if weâre effectively utilizing those five core competitive advantages. And as we looked at the organization, we saw a huge opportunity to start consolidating the businesses and to get rid of our organizational silos to truly leverage not only the scale of every single business weâre in but also the scale associated with looking across those different businesses.",
            "The changes weâve been making are going to allow us . . . to fully leverage these advantages and position our company well in advance of any of our peers.",
            "We recognized that integration comes through value chains and the value that you createâirrespective of which element of that value chain youâre bringing to bear. Our technology organization had been divided among different businesses. Weâve consolidated [these organizations] to make sure we are defining technology and advancing technology based on core capabilities, skill sets, and competencies, not the business weâre in. The changes weâve been making are going to allow usâI think for the first time in the corporationâs historyâto fully leverage these advantages and position our company well in advance of any of our peers. ",
            "What are the biggest risks you see?",
            "One of the unique aspects of our strategy is that weâre not going out and building grassroots capabilities. For the six years Iâve been in this job, particularly early on, I resisted going into wind and solar. Not because we didnât see a market for wind and solar, but because we didnât see how that fit with our core capabilities. We will stay anchored in what we know weâre good at. Weâre a company that has built its success on transforming molecules. Our capabilities are generating revenue in our existing businesses. With the transition, weâll shift those, timed with market development and the ability to generate revenue. And we have tried-and-true practices to execute.",
            "Technology is probably the one area with a lot of uncertainty. Nobody can predict where technological advances will come from. I could see circumstances where a technology is developed outside our company or not in our wheelhouse. But weâre scanning that proactively. What we bring to bear there, if not the direct technology, is the ability to scale that technology. Weâre a global player with the ability to shift resources where they are needed. Itâs not that we arenât exposed to risks, but that weâve significantly mitigated their ability to materially impact the company.",
            "How much leverage does a company like ExxonMobil have to influence the direction of change?",
            "We can play a role in bringing expertise and our understanding of todayâs energy system to bear when talking about how you successfully transition. The time it will take to build these solution sets will be fairly long, and we have an advantage in shifting resources to participate. We can play a role that ensures that policies put in place effectively bring solutions at the lowest cost possible to society, because transitioning an energy system will be an expensive proposition. So I do think we can influence the direction.",
            "What is a leaderâs responsibility to advance the energy discussion?",
            " The role leaders haveâand certainly a role I feel like I haveâis to bring an objective, clear-eyed perspective on the challenges and to talk straight. Thereâs certainly a role for aspirations. But that must be built on a solid understanding of what must happen to effect this change and this transition. The role leaders can have in every sector is to make the effort and the investment to truly understand where we are today, where we need to be, and what that transition and cost will be. This will require society to change and to pay a cost for changing out an industrial sector, a power-generation sector, a mobility sector thatâs been developed over the last 140 years. You need to do the math and then explain the math. And thereâs not enough of that happening today.",
            " Youâve had an eventful six-year tenure as CEO. What personal lessons have you learned?",
            "Coming into this job, my challenge was to make a clear-eyed, objective assessment. Very early on, we recognized that the industry was not investing enough in traditional oil and gas supplies. So we continued to look for attractive, advantaged investments and pursued those quite aggressively. We got a lot of criticism for that. But we kept coming back and challenging ourselves on whether or not we had it right. We were convinced we did, and we stuck with that. As you can see today, it has paid off.",
            "We need to do a better job of offering solutions by focusing on whatâs needed and how we can help.",
            "The other key learningâwhich is the new pieceâis the need for transparency. Our company historically has grown up with, âWeâll let our walk do our talking.â Thatâs how I was raised in the company. You never went to reviews and talked about what you were going to do; you talked about what you were doing and what you were delivering. In todayâs market and society, with all the uncertainty, being much more forward in our discussions about what weâre trying to do, being transparent, was certainly a lesson Iâve learned in this job. We need to do a better job of offering solutions by focusing on whatâs needed and how we can help.",
            "Thereâs a saying that the only way to prepare for the CEO role is to actually do it. Personally, what do you think prepared you to execute as CEO? ",
            " I agree because I think CEO jobs are unique. And certainly, for our company, as large as it is, with as many businesses and sectors and the global expanse we have, thereâs no other job in the company that you could do to prepare you for CEO.",
            "Our development process, which takes people through the jobs that build core capabilities and core strengths which are applicable to this bigger job, has been critical. I had many managers and leaders who put me through the grind and challenged me and helped me stand up to adversity and be clearheaded in thinking about things.",
            "I can still remember being coached in my first supervisory job to understand that I had a role to play in finding the next CEO, because though we couldnât know who it would be, [the selection process] would start by bringing folks in and developing them through their careers. As you challenged people over the course of their careers, what you found were their limits and their constraints, which then set their ultimate potential. For some people, youâd keep looking for those limits and constraints, and you couldnât find them. So youâd take them to the next job and the next job. That process is excellent for eventually stepping into this job, because when you do, that mindsetâthat muscleâis there. I think I was as best prepared as I could be going into this job. But I wouldnât tell you I was fully prepared.",

        "title": "Filling the gap: Boosting supply of recycled materials for packaging",
        "description": "High long-term demand for recycled content in packaging could lead to shortages of recycled packaging materials. We explore three ways to boost rPET availability in the US market.",
        "paragraphs": [
            "to introduce new packaging formats and establish innovative ways to boost product recyclability and levels of recycled content to meet their sustainable-packaging commitments, address consumer concerns, and adapt to rapidly rising regulatory pressure.",
            " However, these companies face the very real risk that they cannot achieve their goals because of an anticipated shortage of recycled materials",
            ": collection levels of high-quality recycled material look set to remain almost flat, creating supply challenges for brand owners and packaging companies. If brands with public recycled-content commitments follow through on their plans, the US demand for recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) in 2030 would outpace supply by about three times. Consequently, as the supply-and-demand imbalance widens, the price premium between rPET and virgin PET has the potential to rise significantly over the next decade. The challenge for the industry moving forward will be to unlock additional rPET supply. To address this issue, we suggest three potential approaches, centered on boosting supply, ensuring access, and designing for circularity, that could also be applicable to other packaging substrates.",
            "Packaging is a ubiquitous part of our daily lives. It minimizes food waste and adds convenience at low cost, but it also imposes a heavy environmental burden, given the United Statesâ low recycling rates.",
            " This has not gone unnoticed. In recent years, consumers globally have become increasingly concerned about packaging waste and leakage into environment, and governments have begun responding to public sentiment with robust action along accelerated timelines.",
            " In parallel, brand owners and the packaging industry have made bold commitments to improve the sustainability of their packaging portfolios through boosting recyclability and levels of recycled content.",
            "This has increased demand for recycled materialsâoften at a green price premium, given the scarcity of supply. Here, we explore the rPET value chain to understand the underlying causes of an anticipated supply-and-demand imbalance. We put forward several approaches to mitigate this issueâapproaches that we believe can also be applied to other packaging substrates (such as glass, metal, paper, and flexibles) that are facing similar market pressures.",
            "A diverse set of end-use applications currently relies on the PET waste streamâtextiles, plastic films, strapping, and food and beverage bottles, among othersâwith PET bottles as the primary feedstock for rPET. Yet today, only about 27 percent of PET bottles and some 18 percent of all recyclable PET plastic waste are collected, with the remainder going to landfills (Exhibit 1). Over the past few years, there has been no step-change increase in PET collection or sorting. As a consequence, rPET supply has only grown at approximately 1 percent per annum over the 2012â22 period in North America.",
            " While there have been some new entrants in the reclamation and reprocessing section of the value chain, there have been no significant corresponding reductions in process losses. This means that approximately 4.6 billion pounds of PET end up in landfills every year.",
            " Collecting this unrecycled plastic represents a significant untapped opportunity to close the loop on food-grade PET.",
            "Importantly, rapidly growing demand, combined with stagnant supply, is expected to result in a significant future supply-and-demand imbalance for rPET (Exhibit 2):",
            "Moving ahead, ESG-driven rPET usage will expand its share of the market, potentially leading to increasing price premiums as demand for rPET grows. Additionally, many brand owners are considering switching away from other plastic resinsâsuch as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polystyreneâin favor of rPET because of its higher recyclability and its perceived accessibility compared with other resins. This could impose further supply pressures.",
            "Future rPET availability will be determined by a combination of supply, demand, and regulatory factors (Exhibit 3), with plateaued supply being of greatest concern. With this in mind, packaging industry leaders can consider three meaningful ways to increase rPET availability:",
            "Importantly, we anticipate that these three enablers will also be applicable to other substrates across the broader packaging market, such as the following:",
            "Sustainability in packaging is a time-sensitive priority for leaders in the packaging industry. Achieving true circularity through higher concentrations of recycled materials is a critical enabler. However, the significant challenge will be for the supply side to keep pace with demand during the remaining years of this decade. There is no time to waste, with multiple ambitious sustainability commitments scheduled for 2025 fast approaching.",

The need for IT services is consistent because the services are often mission critical for customers navigating increasingly complex new technologies, especially if customers lack their own IT talent.",
            "In many ways, the story of the global IT services industry is one of resilience and fragmentation. This combination creates opportunities to create value through M&A. In the private markets, PE firms can use roll-up strategiesâacquiring multiple companies in a sector to consolidate market shareâto achieve economies of scale and bargaining power and to be able to pursue larger clients. On the other side of a transaction, some IT services providers use M&A to exit legacy businesses and to improve the balance between legacy and growth in their portfolios.",
            "To support stakeholders while they look for value creation opportunities through M&A, we have distilled some of our insights into a brief overview of important trends in IT services M&A and outline how investors can use M&A to create significant value.",
            "The IT services market is fragmented and diverse (Exhibit 1).",
            "As of April 2023, the top 15 providers held only about 40 percent of the market.",
            " Our analysis suggests that the industry will likely see some consolidation because niche players may struggle to scale and large providers may seek ways to broaden and strengthen their capabilities.",
            "Over the next five years, we project that a disproportionate part of the industryâs growth will be driven by digital IT, which uses digital technologies and practices such as the cloud, machine learning, and DevOps (software development and IT operations) (Exhibit 2).",
            "Our analysis found more than 100 fast-growing subareas within digital IT. We call them âdigital hot spots.â Each hot spot, which is projected to attract at least $1 billion of annual spending, has its own commercial and technological dynamics, including growth rate. Because of the number and variety of hot spots, many IT services providers find it challenging to build their own capabilities. This presents an opportunity for new entrants to capture a share of the growing market.",
            "M&A is a proven way to create value and build capabilities in emerging digital hot spots (Exhibit 3).",
            " But the kind of M&A matters. As measured by TSR from 2013 to 2022, companies that chose programmatic M&A outperformed their counterparts that emphasized large deals or did not conduct M&A.",
            "Because programmatic M&A helps companies manage overall risk and create significant revenue and cost synergies, IT services providers that rapidly build or scale their capabilities through M&A can break away from the pack and deliver top-quartile shareholder returns.",
            " McKinsey analysis suggests that when done well, M&A can not only help add one to three percentage points to inorganic growth but also lift organic growth and shareholder returns by five to ten percentage points.",
            "When we examine the most successful programmatic M&A programs in IT services, we see three archetypes.",
            " These acquirers use M&A to acquire specialist digital capabilities that are difficult to build organically, and they use M&A to strengthen front-end consulting and design capabilities that are often found in smaller, niche companies.",
            " Their motivation for M&A is to strengthen vertical-domain expertise in existing and adjacent segments and to build end-to-end value propositions in those verticals.",
            " They could use M&A to broaden their offerings to present themselves as one-stop shops for IT services for midsize clients and to access new clients and geographies.",
            "An M&A playbook executed by an experienced team is critical to closing deals and creating significant value. Five elements are particularly important.",
            " In our experience, top-performing companies originate about two-thirds of their own deal flow. They may have an in-house team of researchers to generate leads, which require rigorous screening and prediligence. A short listâabout 5 percent of the full list of original leadsâis then passed along for detailed due diligence.",
            " Strategic investors could borrow practices from PE firms. Elements of an effective governance structure include an internal investment committee (IC) that reviews investment opportunities in two or three stages; a standardized IC memo, the structure of which helps the committee assess dealsâ attractiveness; and strict approval criteria, such as thresholds for internal rates of return.",
            " The assessment of culture fit would ideally be thorough, so much so that it might feel excessive to participants who are not used to it. Clear choices and expectations related to the design of post-M&A integration, particularly when it comes to merging cultures, can ensure that the elements that made the target company and the acquiring company individually successful are preserved.",
            " A cross-functional team should be focused on integrating the two companies. Rigorous tracking is a significant part of this teamâs workâthat is, tracking the integration progress, financial performance (such as revenue growth and margins), and operational metrics (such as attrition and costs per full-time equivalent).",
            " A dedicated corporate development team at the relevant levels can make success more likely at every stage of M&A. Specific individuals could also be assigned as full-time points of contact to support integration.",

            ", McKinseyâs podcast on private markets, McKinsey partner and host Brian Vickery speaks to David Steinbach, the global chief investment officer and cohead of investment management at Hines, one of the largest real estate investors, developers, and service providers in the world. Vickery and Steinbach unpack the findings in the McKinsey Global Instituteâs recent report â",
            ".â",
            " The report explores the implications of hybrid work for real estate today and into the future. Vickery taps into Steinbachâs decades-long career to discuss what he foresees for the industry and how stakeholders can change to rethink space, satisfy tenants, and preserve real estate companiesâ success. An edited version of their conversation follows.",
            "Where do you see the office market today, and how is our current situation an outcome of a much longer-term arc? Our report focused on the impact of hybrid work over the past few years and how that behavioral change has affected real estate, but thatâs only one part of a longer history.",
            "A lot was occurring well before COVID-19 happened. Real estate was becoming a service  industry, and a convergence of product types such as multifamily, retail, and even industrial was under way. In fact, the creation of ecosystems was driving performance in the market. COVID-19 was an accelerant that caused what was already happening to move forward sooner.",
            "When considering the history of the office market in the United States, ",
            " in the 1980s drove a lot of development and even oversupply in most markets. There was the creation of certain funds afterward that erected a lot of that real estate but underinvested in those office buildings for about 15 years. Then interest rates were at 0 percent for about 15 years. All these forces created a dynamic where landlords were incentivized to increase rent and create higher tenant inducements, which distorted the dynamics of supply and demand within office buildings and the expectations tenants have.",
            "So today, there is a lot to unwind. Forty years of incompatible events have caused the real estate industry to get where it is. Itâs important to know this historical context when you think about offices  more broadly.",
            "Real estate has become experiential while these cultural changes are happening, making many buildings today unfit for purpose.",
            "Owners of real estate donât fully know what to do in this new world. If real estate is becoming a service industry and thereâs a shift in tenant expectations, not everyone can deliver upon those changing dynamics. Some of the hardware elements in buildingsâthe bricks and mortar that make it upâare no longer useful or relevant. They need to be radically changed because they donât fit the taste of the modern employee. But the software elementsâthe execution piece that happens inside the four wallsâalso needs to radically evolve to match employeesâ changing tastes.",
            "How are you drawing the line between existential threats and pockets of opportunity?",
            "We can compare this moment in real estate with what happened in retail about ten years ago when e-commerce became popular. There was so much excitement about logistics and the opportunity there. It was certainly a deep pool of opportunity and demand; a lot needed to be built to service the emerging economy. At the same time, if you had painted a broad brush on retail and invested only in e-commerce, you wouldâve missed a lot of opportunities. We saw that the best retail centers did well over the past ten years in terms of rents and footfall and were resilient through COVID-19.",
            "Similarly, one mistake that real estate investors could make is painting their brush too broadly in todayâs market. Right now, people are more interested in multifamily or industrial buildings, but the pools of opportunity there are only so deep. We canât all buy only those two product types and still expect them to be priced to perfection. A smart investor needs to look broadly at the lay of the land and, at every opportunity, think about offices  in addition to all the other sectors and have a vision for what will withstand.",
            "Certain locations and building types with the right amenities and experiences outperform the ones that donât have these features, but those places may have moved as the population has shifted.",
            "When I started underwriting deals years ago, everyone talked about the value of building near executive housing. About a decade ago, it shifted to building where younger people want to be. The next shift could be more about the ecosystemâa convergence of features that makes a place special. Location is important, but itâs not the only metric that matters.",
            "In our report, we found cities that have dense office-centric neighborhoods and less of a mixed-use environment havenât seen the foot traffic and population growth that other cities have. Moreover, transit patterns may have shifted, and location for multifamily, retail, and office real estate matters more than ever. Why do you think the broader landscape has changed in the past five years?",
            "The experience economy is driving a lot of behavior. The demographic profile of many major economies around the world, including the United States, is undergoing some changes. Real estate developers and investors chased millennials as they matured out of universities and moved into urban environments. As that population ages, their needs are going to change, too.",
            "Some of that impact will spread out: many who went to some major markets may want to move closer to home as they have children, as their parents age, or for other reasons. They may also bring a lot of the urban sensibilities they had to other cities, which provides an opportunity to recalibrate how we think about what weâre providing. The built environment responds to demand, and that would be a deep pool of demand.",
            "Responding appropriately to shifting demographics depends on the market youâre in. Itâs important to recognize where new demographics see opportunity and how things must evolve in response. The negativity around urbanization is a bit overdone. Cities will rework themselves. Weâre already seeing that in New York and San Francisco.",
            " Thatâs an important nuance. The people who moved during COVID-19 arenât moving back, but that doesnât mean other people arenât moving in. Cities still have a magnetism for younger generations.",
            "It will take us a long time to witness how hybrid work has truly affected asset classes. Some seasoned investors have been saying that it could take up to ten years. In an unmanaged scenario, we found that office demand in a median city was down by 13 percent, and in a dire scenario, some cities were down by 38 percent. What do you think needs to happen to avoid this prolonged period of uncertainty?",
            "Cities right now are open to change because theyâre seeing their tax base erode, lenders donât want buildings back, and equity holders want to create new opportunities. Importantly, tenants are also open to change. One tipping point for disruption is the alignment of stakeholders, and this uncommon moment will accelerate a lot of change in our industry. Forward-leaning owners and operators, developers, and investors are going to embrace that, and it wonât be a decade in the making.",
            "Tenants are dealing with a lot of uncertainty. They donât want to sign a ten-year lease because they donât know how much space theyâll need in two years. So the model is not working right now.",
            "Itâs all about the customerâthe one whoâs paying the rent. Real estate has lagged behind in its ability to keep up with customer demand and get ahead of what customers want. Data has helped companies greatly. Years ago, for example, we sent people to count cars to estimate a buildingâs vacancy rate. Better data has allowed us to know exactly what a buildingâs vacancy rate is, which helped performance. Productivity will be the next wave. Right now, we donât know what is going on inside a building from the outside, but as we get closer to our tenants, this data will help us approach new builds based on their needs.",
            "That will revolutionize how we think about space, changing from square footage to being about what weâre trying to accomplish within the space. Employers know they have to attract and retain people and keep them happy when theyâre in the office. Employees want a space that is social, creative, and collaborative, which is against the old cubicle mindset.",
            "Historically, offices housed the means of production. Think about how radically the means of production have changed. Our technology has shrunk, and companies within the knowledge economy have created a wave of differentiation based on their  response to these changes. The real estate industry has been slow to respond, but there will be a new wave of thinking in terms of how we serve our tenants and new ways to make money. Thereâs an opportunity to remake what the future of our industry looks like.",

This research explores diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the global private-markets industry, with a focus on private equity and alternative investment firms (PE) and institutional investors. We aim to make this the largest study of gender diversity and ethnic and racial diversity in the global private markets industry.",
            "This yearâs survey covers 66 discrete PE firms and institutional investors around the world. We also conducted interviews with several industry leaders to supplement the survey data we received from their firms. Participating firms directly employ more than 60,000 people globally and range from megafirms with more than $100 billion in assets under management (AUM) to smaller funds with less than $5 billion in AUM. Collectively, participating PE firms manage more than $6 trillion, and participating institutional investors manage more than $5 trillion in AUM.",
            "Given the limitations of data collection, this report largely focuses on gender diversity globally and ethnic and racial diversity in private market firms with offices in the United States and Canada. We recognize there are several other categories that contribute to employee diversity and hope to broaden the categories we examine in future research as private market firms collect more diversity data on their employee base.",
            "This report finds encouraging signs of progress in recent years. Diversity on investment committees (ICs) has ticked up, and the reporting of diversity metrics to institutional investors continues to grow.",
            "Still, gaps remain, particularly regarding gender diversity in senior investing roles and uneven rates of progress for different ethnic and racial groups across roles and regions, and types of firms. Given the current pace of progress, it will be several decades before the PE industry achieves gender parity at the principal and managing-director levels.",
            "Given the current pace of progress, it will be several decades before the PE industry achieves gender parity at the principal and managing-director levels.",
            "There is a popular assumption that PE is dominated by men, but the evidence reveals a more nuanced reality. As we noted last year, PE firms have almost achieved gender parity globally at the entry level. At the end of 2022, 48 percent of all entry-level roles in PE were held by women.",
            "The language we use to classify jobs in private equity (PE) has not changed from last year's. The six levels we identify apply to PE jobs in investing, operational, and other noninvesting functions. For most of these levels, we include multiple possible job titles. In descending order of seniority, the roles are as follows:",
            "L1. C-level executives or fund heads. We refer to this level as the C-level or C-suite.",
            "L2. Managing directors or partners. We refer to jobs at this level as managing directors.",
            "L3. Principals, directors, or senior vice presidents. We refer to jobs at this level as principals.",
            "L4. Vice presidents or senior managers. We refer to jobs at this level as VPs.",
            "L5. Associates or managers. We refer to jobs at this level as associates.",
            "L6. Entry level roles.",
            "For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to each level with only one title.",
            "However, women in PE are still underrepresented in leadership positions, with only 20 percent representation in managing-director roles (for more on job levels, see sidebar âJob levels in private equityâ). As Kelley King, senior vice president and chief DEI officer at HarbourVest, explained, âIdentifying and attracting early-career diverse talent is not as challenging as finding later-career talent. As you ascend higher in the organization, the more patient and intentional firms need to be to reap the benefits of their DEI efforts.â",
            "Disaggregating the data into investing, operating, and other noninvesting roles (the latter of which we will refer to as noninvesting roles) reveals that women hold only 33 percent of entry-level investing roles, compared with 44 percent of operating roles and 59 percent of noninvesting roles at that level. Women are also underrepresented at the managing-director level (L2), with only 15 percent of managing-director-level investing roles (Exhibit 1).",
            "Women in PE have made modest gains in investing roles over the course of 2022. The share of C-suite roles held by women globally increased by 3.5 percentage points over the past year to 17 percent at the end of 2022. Similarly, womenâs representation in post-MBA investing associate (L5) roles improved by three percentage points. However, gender diversity at the managing-director level remained constant.",
            "Women in PE are slightly less represented in operating roles than in investing roles, with women holding only 25 percent of all operating roles. Notably, women in operations have achieved gender parity at the associate level (L5), with 52 percent of roles. However, gender diversity undergoes a steep decline at higher levels, with women holding just 21 percent of managing-director-level (L2) operating jobs.",
            "Progress is generally cause for optimism, but if the pace of progress doesnât accelerate, the path to gender parity in the industry will be long. At the current rate of progress, reaching gender parity in investing roles at the managing-director level (L2) would take more than six decades. Achieving gender parity at the principal level (L3) would take more than three decades (Exhibit 2).",
            "While these numbers are sobering, the outlook is significantly brighter at the entry level. Based on current figures, the industry could reach gender parity at the analyst level (L6) and associate level (L5) within the next decade.",
            "At the current rate of progress, reaching gender parity in investing roles at the managing-director level (L2) would take more than six decades.",
            "In demanding PE careers, women find themselves navigating a longer route to reach the same milestones as their male colleagues. At almost every level, women in investing roles are promoted at significantly lower rates than men. ",
            " a trend that persists across all levels in investing roles (Exhibit 3).",
            "The largest gap affects promotions into the principal level (L3), with men 2.75 times more likely than women to be promoted. One contributor to this disparity may be limited sponsorship and mentorship for women at the vice president (VP) level. As the head of talent for a North American PE fund put it, âAt that [middle] level is where we find a number of ethnic minorities and women who have really felt like the levels they are at have a sticky floor. They found that itâs really hard to get that next promotion. They feel left out. They havenât received the kind of mentorship and the kind of apprenticeship that theyâre really going to need or the sponsorship to get promoted.â",
            "The road to meaningful progress will likely be long. However, thereâs a bright spot: the promotion gap at the managing-director level (L2) shrank in 2022.",
            "Globally, men in investing roles are about 50 percent more likely, on average, to be promoted than their female colleagues.",
            "Some firms have made noteworthy strides on the diversity of their talent pool, so much so that the industryâs global average of women in 15 percent of investing managing-director roles looks paltry by comparison. Leading firms had women in 45 percent of managing-director (L2) roles as the end of 2022. These firms also had significantly higher proportions of women at every level and overall had women in 38 percent of their investing roles, compared with the global average of 25 percent.",
            "Interestingly, firms that were leaders in gender diversity (as indicated by relatively high proportions of women in managing-directorÂ roles) also retained women at higher rates than the industry average. However, firms that lagged on gender diversity showed significantly higher attrition in 2022 among women in investing. These firms in our sample did not have women in managing-directorÂ (L2) investing roles and had only 17 percent women in investing roles overall compared to the 25 percent global benchmark. Furthermore, these firmsâ attrition rates for women in investing were 1.7 times higher, at 27 percent, than the global average over the course of 2022 (Exhibit 4).",
            "For investing roles, our findings suggest a correlation between the representation of women at the top and higher overall gender representation, as well as between lack of women at the top and their ability to retain women at all levels of investing roles.",
            "Our findings on gender diversity over time also highlight the feasibility of substantial progress when decision makers deploy effective strategies. Indeed, the results of our study show that not all PE firms are equal when it comes to cultures that support diverse talent.",
            "The timelines to achieving gender parity vary by region. For instance, despite advances, Europe still faces significant challenges related to womenâs representation at senior levels. At its current pace, Europe would require more than six decades to reach gender parity at senior levels.",
            "By contrast, based on the rate of recent progress, the Americas are the furthest from achieving gender parity at middle and junior levels for investing roles. The situation is notably different in the AsiaâPacific region, which has done the most to close the gender gap at middle and senior levels recently (Exhibit 5).",
            "A concerning trend has emerged over the past two years: gender representation has seen a minor decrease in the AsiaâPacific region at the associate level (L5). Although this decline starts from a relatively high base, it indicates the need for ongoing efforts to maintain a diverse talent pipeline that can help the industry achieve gender parity.",
            "Consistent with our past findings, ethnic and racial minorities in PE face similar underrepresentation as women. At nearly every level, investing roles have lower ethnic and racial diversity than noninvesting and operating-partner roles.",
            "Our research data from the United States and Canada shows that ethnic and racial minorities represent only 20 percent of managing-director-level investing professionals (Exhibit 6). For context, people who identify as ethnic and racial minorities account for 30 percent of the Canadian population and 41 percent of the US population.",
            " However, we found positive progress in ethnic and racial diversity in ICs in 2022. Ethnic and racial minorities represented 18 percent of investment committee members, nearly matching the ethnic and racial diversity of managing directors (L2) that year.",
            "The improvement in the diversity of talent in investment committees over the course of 2022 may be the result of new requirements for PE firms to disclose C-suite- and investment-committee-level diversity data to prospective investors. The chief HR officer of a midsize PE firm headquartered in North America referred to this as âa standard part of the due diligence questionnaire these days.â",
            "Investment professionals who identify as White held 70 percent of all investing roles and 80 percent of managing-directorÂ roles. As of 2022, White men made up the majority of White PE professionals at 79 percent, with 86 percent at the managing-directorÂ level. By contrast, women who identify as ethnic and racial minorities were the least represented group among investment professionals across all levels. White professionals lead promotion rates into every level except principal (L3). The difference in promotion is most drastic at the managing-directorÂ level (L2), in which White professionals were more than 2.3 times more likely to be promoted than any other race or ethnicity. And once they make it to the top, White professionals has the lowest rates of attrition, trailing only Hispanic and Latino investing professionals in attrition rates at the principal level (L3) and managing-directorÂ level (L2).",
            "Not all PE firms have struggled to attract and develop talent from ethnic and racial minorities. Leading firms have reached or are nearing representative levels, with 42 percent of investing talent identifying as ethnic or racial minorities, compared with 30 percent of the Canadian population and 41 percent of the US population.",
            "Lagging firms, on the other hand, have almost no ethnic and racial diversity at senior levels. These challenges at the top are reflected throughout the organization, with only 23 percent of investing professionals at lagging firms identifying as ethnic and racial minorities.",
            "Firms that lead the industry in ethnic and racial diversity have demonstrated that significant progress is possible, but there is still work to be done to make PE offices in the United States and Canada more representative. Black and Hispanic professionals remain underrepresented, even at firms that lead on ethnic and racial diversity. Fourteen percent of the US population is Black, and 19 percent is Hispanic,",
            " but even at leading firms, only 8 percent of managing directors are Black, and 9 percent are Hispanic.",
            "When making funding decisions, institutional investors increasingly take PE firmsâ DEI practices into account.",
            "Institutional investors are broadening their view of DEI beyond the investment team and institutional investors now increasingly ask about DEI metrics within portfolio companies and their boards (Exhibit 7). This growing interest from institutional investors has encouraged PE firms to systematically track and report on these metrics, fueling momentum toward diversity and inclusion in the industry. As a partner at a North American PE fund put it, âData requests from LPs [limited partners] on diversity and inclusion have gone from zero in the 2000s to everyone asking about it today.â",
            "Notably, some institutional investors track PE firmsâ year-over-year improvements in diversity and inclusion as part of their DEI assessments. Forward-looking institutional investors have started to move beyond simply tracking DEI metrics and are beginning to set minimum thresholds on some metrics. For instance, one institutional investor in our sample requires PE firms to meet minimum racial- and gender-diversity thresholds before the institutional investor considers making an investment.",
            "Institutional investors are continuing to gather data on diversity inclusion. But are their allocations consistent with their stated priorities?",
            "Institutional investors that participated in last yearâs study said they would be willing to give more capital to more-diverse deal teams.",
            " However, institutional investors face challenges in making that promise a reality. As of 2021, PE firms owned by ethnic and racial minorities and women managed only 6 percent of total AUM in PE.",
            " If diversity is high on institutional investorsâ priority list, why donât minority-owned funds receive more capital?",
            "The hurdle for minority- and women-owned funds is not their track record or the investing teamâs experience. The challenges are structural and make it harder for institutional investors to allocate to these firms. For instance, compared with their competitors, minority- and women-owned firms are smaller and newer on average. In the current macroeconomic environment, institutional investors are relying more on existing long-term relationships with general partners to weather the cycle, leaving even fewer slots for these firms to compete over. To connect with these firms, institutional investors would have to go through brokers or adjust their minimum allocation rules to directly invest in smaller raises.",
            "As institutional investors continue to shape the future of private equity, their influence will be vital in ensuring that DEI remains top of mind. Through thoughtful capital allocation and continued focus on DEI metrics, institutional investors have the power to drive meaningful change in the sector, making PE more inclusive, more diverse, and ultimately more successful.",
            "Our study highlights that to achieve a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive industry, firms require additional internal actions and practices as well as external pressures. Strategies to retain and promote diverse talent within PE firms would need to coexist with a collaborative commitment from institutional investors to demand DEI metrics and support women- and minority-owned funds. Our discussion focuses on specific actions and regional considerations that can accelerate the path to greater diversity of talent within investing roles in private markets globally.",
            "PE firms have made initial progress in diversifying their entry-level talent pipelines. To establish a more inclusive culture and move toward gender parity, those efforts would need to extend to the senior ranks. Itâs important for practices that promote diversity and inclusion to be embedded in every level of the organization. DEI should not be seen as just a recruitment initiative.",
            "Key practices to implement include the following:",
            "These initiatives go beyond recruitment and are crucial in building an inclusive environment that not only welcomes diverse team members but also enables them to flourish and ascend the ranks. By committing to these practices, PE firms can nurture diversity throughout their organizations, from the entry level to top leadership.",
            "The road toward equity in PE is long, but a continued focus on actions that could accelerate progress can put the industryâs aspirations within reach. Institutional investors can continue to reinforce the industryâs commitment to DEI, and by acting on these commitments, PE firms can hone the edge that comes with diversity.",

            " Within this world, software and the software-as-a-service (SaaS) sector have long been preeminent thanks to a combination of growth, profitability, and sectorwide multiple expansion. But our analysis found that recent market corrections have depressed valuations in the space by more than 40 percent.",
            "Recent marquee exits by PE firms in the tech services segment have also brought tech services into the spotlight for investors that were traditionally more focused on software.",
            " We estimate that tech services currently accounts for 25 to 30 percent of the total assets under management in tech. This represents a ten-percentage-point increase over the past decade.",
            "Disruptive technological innovations have created opportunities across a range of assets. However, understanding the structural differences between software and SaaS and tech servicesâparticularly between their business modelsâis important. Stakeholders, especially PE investors, may consider carefully evaluating these differences when assessing the segment. Here are a few key insights.",
            "Disruptive technological innovations have created opportunities across a range of assets. However, understanding the structural differences between software and SaaS and tech servicesâparticularly between their business modelsâis important.",
            "We observe three considerations that PE firms could keep in mind when venturing into the tech services space.",
            " Tech services companies have lower valuations compared to software and SaaS companies with analogous performance as measured by the Rule of 40 (that the sum of a software companyâs growth rate and profit margin should be greater than 40 percent). However, tech services companies that exceed the threshold of the Rule of 40 see a disproportionate jump in their valuation multiples (Exhibit 1).",
            " Our analysis shows that the enterprise-value-to-revenue ratio almost doubles when companies cross the Rule of 40 threshold compared to their counterparts with annual earnings growth of 30 to 40 percent. The difference between these two cohorts is explained by the difference in their revenue growth profiles. In short, investors are willing to pay a premium for tech services companies that can deliver industry-leading revenue growth with high efficiency.",
            " A companyâs service portfolio mix is critical for revenue and returns (Exhibit 2). Specialization and exposure to new digital technologiesâsuch as the cloud, data and analytics, cybersecurity, the Internet of Things, and blockchainâare essential for higher performance and valuation.",
            "Weâve observed that system integrators with a mix of digital and traditional technologies and providers focused on infrastructure services tend to trade at a discount and struggle to significantly boost their earnings. In contrast, companies that specialize in digital and new technologies have shown that they could produce higher revenue, margins, and returns. This suggests that it is important for tech services companies to have a well-defined service portfolio mix.",
            " Multiple expansion in software and SaaS has been a prime driver of the sectorâs high returns, particularly when PE investors invested in assets that were about to breach the Rule of 40 threshold and when theyâve exited through IPOs.",
            "Although they enjoy a valuation premium, high-performing tech services companies above the 40 percent threshold from the Rule of 40 have still delivered unlevered returns (assuming that 100 percent of investments are equity, with no leverage) of 20 to 25 percent.",
            " If these were typical tech services deals, which use leverage for 50 to 60 percent of the funding, the levered returns would be 40 to 45 percent (Exhibit 3).",
            "Our experience suggests that, unlike in software and SaaS, returns in tech services are mostly the result of performance rather than multiple expansion. However, our assessments of recent exits show that PE investors that significantly boost a tech services companyâs performance have also received an additional 25 to 30 percent in returns from multiple expansion in the sector.",
            "These findings underscore the importance of a thorough evaluation of tech services targetsâ business models. Investors would ideally account for factors such as targetsâ service portfolio mix, specialization, and exposure to emerging technologies.",
            "Itâs also important to assess the potential for using operational improvements to achieve higher multiples. However, evidence from the recent past suggests that this is the exception rather than the rule, and PE investors would ideally avoid relying on multiple expansion to generate returns in tech services.",
            "Our analysis of past PE deals in tech services found many successful exits and a few that generated outsize returns of more than 25 percent. We found almost no failed exits. A close examination of those deals revealed that the companies had five things in common:",
            "The playbook for these outcomes is fairly straightforward, and a few PE investors use this as their go-to approach for achieving stable and satisfying returns in tech services.",
            "Less glamorous than software or SaaS, tech services companies create value through performance. Decision makers attuned to the dynamics specific to the sector may uncover insights and returns.",

        "title": "Applied AI: Six growth considerations for private markets",
        "description": "As applied AI heats up, we identified key six findings for stakeholders, including investors, to keep in mind as they think about companies in the industry.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " are surging in applied AI. Recent displays of capabilities in areas such as generative AI have further boosted the technologyâs profile.",
            "Of course, the industry is still young, with plenty of opportunities for growth as organizations increase their adoption of AI and their spending on the technology. McKinsey analysis suggests that the value at stake from AI can reach $15 trillion.",
            " For now, however, market penetration is still very low: about 50 to 60 percent of companies have deployed AI but have not scaled it.",
            " We estimate a ceiling of about 30 percent market adoption in AIâs mature use cases for individual business functions. The technologyâs commercial potential has drawn a flood of private investment, which hit a record $93.5 billion in 2021.",
            "This attention is partly based on the industryâs high growth. But at the same time, our analysis of software and applied-AI companies shows that AI companies are less efficient at generating revenue compared with their software-as-a-service (SaaS) counterparts. Still, the sector will likely continue to be commercially and technologically significant. We offer a short perspective on the possible direction of the growing industry.",
            "Our analysis of 187 software and AI companies in our benchmark database shows that while applied-AI companies have promising growth profiles, their revenue is less repeatable and efficient compared with that of traditional SaaS companies (exhibit).",
            "Specifically, the average applied-AI company has a growth efficiency (the ratio of realized annual recurring revenue to marketing and sales spending) of about 70 percent, compared with about 95 percent for their SaaS counterparts. According to our analysis, three key factors appear to contribute to this difference.",
            " Prospective buyers donât necessarily consider applied-AI solutions and their propositions to be mission critical, particularly because companies may lack a robust track record of applied-AI use casesâalthough the buzz surrounding generative AI is starting to shift this mindset. At the same time, the sales path for applied-AI solutions is often unclear, including considerations such as which stakeholders have budgets for AI solutions. The lack of both clear targets and an obvious way forward extends the sales cycle. As a result, the lifetime value of applied-AI customers is lower than it is for SaaS customers, even with nearly identical average customer churns of about 15 percent per year. However, the push to adopt generative AI may change this in the near future.",
            " The applied-AI companies in the top quartile of our data set spend 40 percent of their revenue on general and administrative expenses and 50 percent of their revenue on R&D. Both numbers are more than ten percentage points higher than their equivalents for their SaaS peers.",
            "Traditional software is developed once and can be shipped an infinite number of times. In contrast, applied-AI companiesâ spending efficiency tends to be limited as they scale. Applied-AI companies take on manual activities such as data cleansing and model tuning more often, pay more for scarce AI talent, work more directly with data because of demand for specialization and responsiveness, and bear considerable ongoing costs for data storage and computing for product development.",
            " Because of the scarcity and high cost of AI talent, the strongest-performing applied-AI companies provide AI-specific professional services to their buyers.",
            "However, these offerings may affect revenue growth: fees may increase to the total contract value, but the services are often not easily repeatable, cannot rapidly scale, and are costly to maintain.",
            "Six considerations can help stakeholders think about applied-AI companies as the industry develops.",
            "Applied-AI investments would ideally have a clear market niche with adjacencies. In informal interactions, experts in the industry suggest that a company with a niche in the $15 trillion total addressable market might have a serviceable available market worth $1 billion to $3 billion and focus on a market segment that combines factors such as geography, industry, the end customer, and business function.",
            "The ideal applied-AI company would also have a combination of captive users, private data sets, or other protective assets stemming from their technology, data, or machine-learning capabilities. These advantages can help them stay ahead of competitors that may use open-source tools or public data to develop their offerings.",
            "Stakeholders could also look for signs of early customer evangelism. This authentic, unsolicited enthusiasm for their products could confirm that the AI use case is critical to their customers, rather than a nice to have. Beyond that, network effectsâfrom data assets or expertiseâmay be a sign that a companyâs offerings could be resistant to commoditization and margin compression.",
            "While the value of applied AI is generally accepted, not all buyers are convinced that applied-AI solutions are critical. Go-to-market strategies should therefore use a segmentation approach that emphasizes buyer segments in which sustaining an operating model without innovative technologies is increasingly difficult. That is, applied-AI solutions may be most valuable to buyers in industries that are highly competitive and in which technology can provide a critical advantage. Of course, this approach to buyer segmentation should complementânot replaceâtraditional ways of articulating companiesâ value proposition.",
            "Decision making related to adopting an AI solution is often shared among managers, business users, data scientists, and IT professionals. Such buyer personas often play different roles in the purchasing and adoption journey, such as decision maker, champion, and end user. Since the personas and roles will likely differ, AI solutionsâ value proposition might be distinct for each persona to best address their pain points, needs, and goals. These considerations may require the coordinated use of diverse channels on the way to a purchasing consensus.",
            "The commercially and strategically strongest AI and machine-learning product companies build workflows that capture the entire user process and, crucially, create feedback loops and reinforcement learning so end users can contribute to the AI by confirming or disagreeing with its outputs.",
            "Of course, just as with SaaS, lock-in and customer stickiness will likely come from a strong go-to-market approach, control over the postsales process, and a deep understanding of vertical application (in which a solution is designed for the specific needs of a market, industry, or company).",
            "AI companies are seeing advantages in developing ways to optimize spending in product development. R&D partnerships and improved tooling in data and model development in product engineering, also known as MLOps, can help. Any efficiencies can be built into the product, which could help the company create revenue more efficiently.",
            "As individual AI companies gain traction and expand their market share, they would ideally become embedded in their customersâ processes and capture their customers for the long term. To do this, AI companies could plan for three key waves of adoption.",
            "The first wave is early adoption, which is ongoing. Applied-AI solutions currently provide improvements to traditional business processes, prove their value, and manage risks en route to establishing productâmarket fit. In this phase, AI solutions would be easy to use, likely by providing an interface that fits into customersâ current ways of working.",
            "The second wave is step-change innovation, which could occur over the course of about three years after a productâmarket fit is established. In this phase, AI becomes embedded in business processes and operates with significant human oversight.",
            "Last, AI might disrupt conventional workflows, with AI solutions taking the place of existing processes. This phase requires mature and tested technology that is highly embedded in businesses, so much so that stakeholders would have a hard time imagining working without the AI-powered solutions. This relationship with AI-powered solutions would spur businesses to reorganize around them, becoming long-term customers.",
            "Applied AI has attracted a surge of investor attention thanks to rocketing public awareness, but a thoughtful approach can help companies make their way toward sustainability and continued growth.",

After three decades of a stable economic order that helped facilitate strong returns and steady growth, institutional investors now face a new era marked by uncertainty, disruption, and radical shifts in public expectations of business and society. A global pandemic, a war in Europe, an energy crisis, disruptions in global supply chains, inflation, and growing social division are just a few signs of disorder. In this context, the course of future events has become much harder to foresee and returns may be more difficult to come by. ",

            "To understand how institutional investors are responding to the new circumstances, we collected perspectives from senior executives at 40 of the worldâs leading pension and sovereign-wealth funds, which collectively manage $10 trillion in assets. Our research uncovered insights into how institutional investors are navigating these external upheavals. As they aim to evolve their strategies in a far more unpredictable world, leading institutions are seeking to hone their âperformance edgeâ by focusing on purpose, portfolio construction, and proficiency.",
            "Past turning points have released forces that fundamentally shaped the subsequent era. Consider how the breakup of the Soviet Union ushered in three decades of peace, rising prosperity, and global economic integration that institutional investors have grown accustomed to. In that environment, the median institutional investor produced 9.5 percent in annual returns from 2012 to 2021 (exhibit).",
            "Institutional investors we interviewed unanimously agree that the current environment is radically different from the global investment conditions of the previous three decades. Indeed, interviewees recognize ",
            ": shifts in the world order, technology platforms, demographic forces, resource and energy systems, and capitalization.",
            "Changes in the world order are top of mind for institutional investor leaders globally. Ninety percent of interviewees cited these changes as a concern. The leader of a sovereign wealth fund said that the possibility of further geopolitical shocks has caused a rethinking of its investment horizon. Geopolitical tensions could also force institutions to divide their investment operations to limit information sharing. And many see an increase in economic regionalization.",
            "Technology emerged as an area of focus for more than four-fifths of respondents. Institutional investors are beginning to incorporate technology into their investment processes. They have also become targets of cyberattacks. In 2022, there was a 243 percent increase in ransomware attacks, a 269 percent increase in crypto jacking, and a 94 percent increase in intrusion attempts.",
            " This ongoing threat is causing leading institutions to bolster their risk management.",
            "Demographics looms large, with 76 percent of respondents raising it as an area of focus. Declining social mobility, increasing economic inequality, political polarization, and aging populations have prompted a renewed focus on social issues as an investment criterion and a consideration in guiding investorsâ businesses.",
            "By far the most salient challenge for interviewees is global resources and energy systems. All investors we spoke to said it was a defining issue for their investment strategies. The amount of capital expenditure required is vast: about ",
            ".",
            " Institutional investor executives anticipate that they will be expected to finance a significant proportion of this outlay.",
            "Many interviewees expressed unease about the challenges of reaching net zero and of managing pressure from vocal stakeholders who object to the adoption of net-zero strategies. They are constrained in their ability to accelerate the pace of change, particularly because the transition to net zero is riddled with challenges and nuances. For instance, one North American CEO pointed out that simply divesting from high-emitting assets is not an answer. Whatâs more, many expressed worry about the green transition creating further strain on global energy markets.",
            "Last, three-quarters of interviewees named capitalization as a concern. Many described the rebalancing of the global balance sheet currently underway as a reset or a regime change. One North American chief investment officer considers this to be a near-term headwind for all asset classes but expects to persist with fundamental portfolio construction in the belief that the inflationary environment is here to stay.",
            "In this context, institutional investors will need to be faster, nimbler, and better at anticipating and responding to change. Our interviews revealed that investors are intensely focused on three areas.",
            "Institutional investors are built to deliver returns to their beneficiaries. But integrating environmental and social considerations is increasingly important. This change is highly visible as it relates to climate change, perhaps the worldâs biggest long-term problem. As one interviewee observed, sustainable investing and long-term investing are the same thing. ",
            "When it comes to social considerations, institutional investors are at different stages of developing their strategies, with some launching social-impact investment programs while others focus on monitoring social factors within their portfolios. As institutional investors have intensified their work on social considerations, diversity within their own ranks has also come into focus; more than a quarter of institutions covered in our research have committed to improving diversity in the industry.",
            "The challenge for investors is to develop a distinctive and nimble approach to portfolio construction. Intervieweesâ short-term focus is to derisk their portfolios, paying attention to inflation-linked assets if they believe higher levels of inflation may be entrenched. Asset allocation is becoming more dynamic, with investors adjusting their exposures based on their expectations of medium-term trends.",
            "As the macroeconomic environment becomes more challenging, many institutional investors are reexamining how they invest in private markets, paying more attention to their private-market exposures and the partners that manage them. More investors are jumping into early-stage investing, attracted by the value creation happening in the early stages of companiesâ development. ",
            "Institutional investors have diverging views on emerging markets. While some investors are responding to current conditions by pulling back from emerging markets, others are continuing to buy but are increasingly focused on each countryâs strengths and weaknesses.",
            "As institutional investors have grown in scale and scope, many have sought to increase internal capabilities and move away from working with external partners. However, institutional investors recognize they cannot internally hold the full range of capabilities needed to thrive in an uncertain world.",
            "A major question is where to focus on building capabilities and where to partner. Many institutional investors are building expertise in select areas and partnering with other organizations to complement their core capabilities. Some are exploring ways to combine resources to create longer-term, more stable pools of capital.",
            "Technology can help support decision making around investments, and interviewees indicated that they are embedding data and analytics into their investment and portfolio management processes. Several leading investors are embedding digital and analyticsâenabled tools directly into investment teams, with the goal of bypassing the need for separate analytics teams.",
            "In the face of increased reliance on technology, many investors are looking to shore up capabilities in risk management, including in critical areas such as cybersecurity. Many institutions are responding to increasing risk by incorporating cyber risk in their due-diligence processes and reassessing their organizational cybersecurity.",
            "Industry-wide, collaboration between institutional investors can help drive consensus on policy matters such as standardized environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics. Institutional investors are also increasingly compelled to work with public-sector stakeholders on global issues such as decarbonization, an area in which governments will likely be unable to underwrite the necessary investment on their own. ",
            "These changes, particularly ones related to internalizing capabilities, necessarily affect investorsâ talent strategy. Professionals with skills in IT and responsible investing remain difficult to attract and retain. And many organizations are responding to macroeconomic challenges by looking for talent with skills such as partnership building and expertise across asset classes.",
            "We believe this new era for institutional investors will create greater dispersion in investment outcomes. The institutional investors that evolve their purpose, their portfolios, and their proficiency to become more resilient, nimble, and responsive to the changing environment will have an edge in the next decade.

        "paragraphs": [
            " Congress has passed three landmark investment billsâthe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS)âdirecting more than $2 trillion in investment to bolster physical infrastructure, promote innovation and economic competitiveness, and shore up the domestic industrial base.",
            " This suite of legislation also aims to redress long-standing inequalities by laying a stronger foundation for sustainable and inclusive growth. Two of these laws in particularâthe BIL and the IRAâpresent a unique opportunity for public leaders to adopt a customer-centric approach to infrastructure strategy to ensure that communities and other stakeholders that historically had little to no say over large-scale projects are included in decision making and empowered to pursue funding opportunities.",

            ", representing views from McKinseyâs Public Sector Practice.",
            "While the BIL allocates a majority of its funding by applying a fixed formula, the law is distinct from past investments in that roughly 40 percent of all net new grant funding opportunities are available through competitive application processes.",
            " These competitive opportunities encompass more than $180 billion in available grant moneyâa resource pool that can empower state and local governments to develop infrastructure strategies that address the needs of all residents, including marginalized communities. These opportunities are further amplified by an additional $80 billion in competitive grants from the IRA.",
            "Government leaders can approach funding pursuit and deployment from a customer-centric perspective by engaging communities that have been underrepresented in shaping public works. Our recent State of the States research, which surveyed 80,000 Americans across all 50 states, found that residentsâ experiences with government services can vary significantly within states depending on their identity, location, and access to resources.",
            " A relentless focus on customer experience could therefore help anchor state-level priorities in residentsâ core pain points and maximize the impact of federal dollars.",
            "State leaders may face significant challenges in engaging a diverse range of voices in making plans and decisions about public investment. Public-works projects with negative second- and third-order effects are seared into the collective memory, leading to mistrust and skepticism that these projects could have a positive impact on the lives and livelihoods of all residents.",
            "There can also be resistance, with communities objecting to projects that are close to home and citing disruptions to neighborhoods and ecosystems.",
            "To navigate these challenges and harness federal infrastructure funds in the service of sustainable, inclusive economic growth, state leaders could consider three actions: identifying a broad range of state-specific stakeholders, including those that represent marginalized groups; optimizing funding by providing targeted support to critical stakeholders as they pursue competitive grant opportunities; and considering proactive steps to promote transparency at each stage of the infrastructure investment journey.",
            "State leaders could begin the infrastructure investment and delivery journey by gathering investment ideas from critical stakeholders and generating community buy-in. This approach could help build greater trust between policy makers and communities that have been historically left out of infrastructure decisions. State-specific stakeholders could include eligible recipients of funding (for example, municipal governments, public utilities, and federally recognized tribes) as well as the residents represented by these recipients.",
            "To begin identifying and mapping these critical stakeholders, state leaders could blend a data-driven perspectiveâinformed by publicly available sourcesâwith qualitative insights. For example, the Council on Environmental Qualityâs Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool collects data across eight categories (including climate change, energy, and health) to help policy makers identify underserved communities that could benefit from public infrastructure investment.",
            " A data-driven approach can also help policy makers deliver on the federal governmentâs Justice40 Initiative, which aims to have at least 40 percent of the benefits from major federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities.",
            "Another resource to consider is the Transportation Disadvantaged Census Tracts tool created by the US Department of Transportation.",
            " The geospatial mapping tool uses American Community Survey and US Census data to identify disadvantaged census tracts across six key indicators (for example, transportation access disadvantage) and can help policy makers pinpoint areas in which infrastructure investment has not kept pace with more affluent communities.",
            " begin reaching out to a diverse range of communities, it is important to create opportunities for meaningful engagement at each stage of the infrastructure investment and delivery journey. For example, tribal leaders have shared that they want to be engaged throughout the decision-making process and collaborate closely on capital planning and grant prioritization. To set the stage for a constructive partnership, state leaders could consider appointing a dedicated tribal infrastructure liaison to streamline communication and foster inclusive decision making. Going above and beyond existing approaches to tribal consultation could help build trust and convey a level of seriousness about the stateâs collaborative vision. The tribal infrastructure liaison may consider engaging with intertribal organizations as an intermediary between the state and federally recognized tribes, especially given frequent turnover in tribal leadership. Holding events in community spaces on tribal lands can also increase participation and awareness. Finally, beyond engaging tribes themselves, state leaders could build and maintain support for tribal projects by emphasizing that investments in tribal communities may confer benefits on all residents who commute through or work on tribal lands.",
            "Once state leaders have built a data-driven perspective on underserved municipalities with pressing infrastructure needs, public affairs staff could collaborate with municipal governments to identify partners in these areas that are best positioned to represent their communities, including not-for-profits, civic organizations, small businesses, and religious institutions. Recognizing the nuances and needs of specific communities could make outreach more effective and help states build trust-based relationships early in the infrastructure investment journey (see sidebar, âEngaging tribal nationsâ).",
            "Once infrastructure stakeholders have been identified, engaging them meaningfully could be informed by five key considerations:",
            "State leaders could help optimize the flow of funds into their state by providing hands-on support to critical stakeholders.",
            "Because new federal funding allows a diverse range of entities (such as states, local governments, tribal governments, utilities, not-for-profits, and research institutions) to apply for competitive grants (both directly and as subgrantees), state leaders could help optimize the flow of funds into their state by providing hands-on support to critical stakeholders. For instance, the executive director of a digital equity not-for-profit told us that states could help alleviate resource constraints for small not-for-profits by managing the administrative side of grant applications and providing support with reporting during project implementation. By taking a direct role in the application process, state leaders could help direct federal funds to grassroots organizations that are working directly with communities, increasing the overall flow of funds into the stateâs economy (that is, beyond grants that go directly to the state government).",
            "When deciding how to structure support, state leaders could take stock of the common challenges that applicants face when pursuing competitive funding opportunities:",
            "Three models, pursued together, could help support stakeholders to overcome these common grant application challenges:",
            "States could centralize their technical-assistance services. For example, support centers with dedicated staffâgrant writers, technical experts, and communications professionalsâcould help stakeholders secure funding for infrastructure projects (Exhibit 1). Support centers could be particularly helpful when federal support is lacking or when state officials want to play an active role in guiding the application process. They could also help stakeholders comply with eligibility requirements, establish performance management processes, and build credibility with federal agencies (for instance, through letters of support). To operationalize this approach, states could take inspiration from federal agencies with experience providing technical assistance. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has created 29 environmental finance centers to help disadvantaged communities access grants for clean water, clean air, and greenhouse-gas reduction; technical assistance includes hands-on support for project proposals and grant applications.",
            "Without coordination, different groups within a state could end up applying for the same funding, potentially canceling each other out or missing opportunities that are more suited to their needs. By convening stakeholders with common or overlapping interests, state leaders could facilitate discussions about which projects to prioritize and even increase awareness of other funding opportunities (Exhibit 2).",
            "For example, the Abandoned Mines Reclamation Program uses fees paid by currently operational coal mining companies to reclaim coal mines abandoned before 1977, making these areas safer for people and the environment. Bringing together groups that focus on watersheds, recreation, or conservation could enable state leaders to identify applications with the most impact and plan strategically to maximize the opportunity to reclaim coal mines. Convening critical stakeholders can also be an effective way to provide technical assistance at scale. For example, the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA) is conducting a series of meetings across the state to help local governments and other stakeholders prepare for and access federal broadband grants (such as the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program or the Digital Equity Act).",
            " Beyond promoting awareness, ADECA is supporting local stakeholders with mapping, planning, data collection, and overall strategy.",
            "States could also consider forming partnerships with a variety of stakeholders (Exhibit 3). These partnerships can take a number of forms:",
            " When both the state and another critical stakeholder (such as an industry representative or a not-for-profit) are eligible for a certain kind of funding, they could apply jointly. Depending on the grant program, the state may choose to form a partnership with multiple groups. For example, the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvement grant program aims to improve the safety and efficiency of passenger and freight rail. States could partner with Amtrak, Class II or Class III railroads, rail equipment manufacturers, universities, and not-for-profits to support shared research, safety, or workforce development goals.",
            " This approach could allow states to gather input from potential subgrantees and applicants during the planning process, which can be required to unlock the stateâs competitive or formula infrastructure funding. States could start by identifying programs in which the state receives funds initially but is later responsible for providing grants to other entities. The Small, Underserved, and Disadvantaged Communities grant program of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act is one such example. While this is not a competitive program, states are required to submit draft work plans to confirm that the eventual use of funds aligns with the requirements of the program.",
            " Coordinating early and often with underserved communities can help ensure that these investments in water infrastructure address the most pressing contamination and water quality issues.",
            " State-to-state relationships could allow states to collaborate on complex grant applications for which implementation will cross state borders, such as interstate highway projects. Another example is the $8 billion Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program. Under the BIL, the Department of Energy is offering grants to industry, utilities, state and local governments, and other entities to improve clean-hydrogen production, processing, delivery, storage, and end use. Given that Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs grants will be awarded to different regions of the country, states could form partnerships or coalitions to capitalize on each stateâs distinct advantages (for instance, talent, infrastructure, or feedstock diversity).",
            " By working together, states could increase the overall competitiveness of applications and drive regional economic growth.",
            "Interactive, public-facing dashboards provide a high-impact way of engaging the public.",
            "During project implementation, state leaders could take proactive steps to share information, promote transparency, and generate buy-in. Interactive, public-facing dashboards provide a high-impact way of engaging the public and could be linked to internal performance management infrastructure to create a single source of truth and minimize reporting friction. Public-facing dashboards could support transparency throughout the infrastructure investment and delivery journey by raising awareness of the following:",
            "To be sure, dashboards and other forms of digital engagement are not a substitute for traditional, nondigital channels, especially given the digital divide and its disproportional impact on marginalized communities.",
            " However, by centralizing information and tracking progress, dashboards can help promote accountability and advance key equity goals. States looking to implement this approach could look to Utahâs IIJA Opportunity Tracker for inspiration.",
            "There is no single standard formula for engaging stakeholders successfully, but state leaders could draw on best practices in customer experience to ensure that infrastructure investments yield positive benefits for all residents. Taking a data-informed, human-centered approach to identifying stakeholders, choosing inclusive formats for engagement, providing hands-on support, and promoting transparency during project execution could help state leaders connect infrastructure investments to the lived experience of residents and set a new bar for effectively implementing federal programs.",

For example, healthcare remains a growth engine for the US workforce but is one of the slowest in terms of labor productivity growth.",
            " Government is also largely a services industry and offers one of the economyâs largest productivity improvement opportunities.",
            "For nearly all countries, government represents the largest portion of the economy and is the biggest employer (Exhibit 1). For example, in the United States, government at all levels accounted for about 47 percent of GDP and about 17 percent of total employment in 2020.",
            " Furthermore, government plays a critical role in society, ranging from building roads to educating youth. In many cases, when the government intervenes, it is necessary because there is no functioning competitive private counterpart.",
            "Moreover, the imperative to capture the government productivity improvement opportunity has intensified. The COVID-19 pandemic put pressure on economies around the world, prompting governments to spend large amounts of money to distribute COVID-19 relief. As COVID-19 moves to an endemic phase, new macroeconomic issues have emerged, most notably a talent shortage, inflation, and high debt-servicing costs.",
            " For example, in 2022, the US federal government spent the largest amount ever on debt interest, reaching nearly 2 percent of GDP.",
            " Having to get by with both a smaller workforce and weaker government balance sheets suggest that the need for productivity improvements has increased.",
            " is used in many contexts with different intentions. For example, leaders want to talk to each other about productivity but may use conflicting definitions when they do so, leading to disagreements. For this article, we employed a definition of productivity that economists commonly use to conduct industry-level analyses.",
            " This focuses on minimizing the inputs required to produce a set of outputs (exhibit).",
            "To understand why it has been difficult to measure productivity in government, it is helpful to first look at how productivity is measured in the private sector. With respect to the equation in the exhibit, in industries such as manufacturing, input and output prices and volume produced are quantifiable. Inputs represent the cost of goods, sales, general administrative expenses, and other such operating costs for goods or services produced. Outputs are estimated by the price a consumer is willing to pay, which accounts for the quality of the good or service, multiplied by the volume. To measure productivity, it is critical to be able to separate price and volume.",
            "When government is involved, inputs and outputs are much harder to measure. Researchers have tried to overcome this problem in a few ways. One approach has been to conduct international comparisons between governments; this offers insight into the productivity improvement opportunity at the national level.",
            " For example, healthcare spending could be compared across countries, such as the United States and Canada. But these comparisons may be misleading because they do not easily take into account differences in how government delivers services or the need for more or less spending. Continuing with the example, the largely public, single-payer healthcare system in Canada may not need as much money as the market-based models in the United States. This approach also tends to exclude state- or local-level comparisons.",
            "Another approach has been to dive deeply into a set of government organizations and develop specific metrics. For example, to examine the efficiency of public-health initiatives, some efforts have tracked microlevel operational metrics, such as house visits by individual healthcare workers.",
            " These can be helpful to the extent that the metrics are operationally focused. The challenge with this approach is that it is hard to aggregate up to the total opportunity across the government.",
            "In our view, these two approaches are directionally correct but are each incomplete. Neither provides a comprehensive road map for the government to measure productivity improvement opportunities across the full range of functions it provides.",
            "Furthermore, when estimating productivity for government, it is important to separate efficiency from effectiveness. Productivity as defined in this article is related to the creation of goods and services; this is efficiency of production. The government also sets policy, the assessment of which concerns questions of effectiveness. While efficiency is tied to specific, measurable units (that is, detailed outputs and inputs), questions of effectiveness focus on how outputs translate into desired policy outcomes, such as shifts in wealth among population groups. Effectiveness is outside the scope of this article.",
            "In this article, we set out to estimate the size of the US governmentâs productivity improvement opportunity. We defined productivity as operational efficiency; other researchers have focused on policy effectiveness (see sidebar âWhy has it been difficult to measure government productivity?â). We quantified the US government productivity improvement opportunity by levelâfederal as well as state and localâand category, such as healthcare or road transport.",
            "Overall, we found a $725 billion to $765 billion productivity improvement opportunityâthat is, roughly $750 billion annually that could be saved while keeping government services operating just as effectively. This would be equivalent to more than $2,000 per resident. About 60 percent of the total was at the state and local level. Across categories, about 40 percent of the opportunity was in healthcare; 9 percent was in primary and secondary education.",
            "We also converted this opportunity into an operational framework that could aid government organizations in determining what actions to take. Based on our experience with hundreds of public- and private-sector organizations, the framework suggests that operational challenges lie in an organizationâs ",

            " to improve.",
            "We recognize and acknowledge that a variety of civic compacts shape how governments set priorities, and thus governments have fundamentally different imperatives than those of the private and social sectors. Government organizations may make productivity trade-offs in service of those institutional imperatives. In this report, productivity is the focus, but it is just one way of evaluating government activity.",
            "To estimate the US government productivity improvement opportunity, we used a previously published approach by the McKinsey Global Institute and adapted it to conduct a country-specific analysis.",
            " This approach accounts for both cost and quality and is applied to the federal level and the state and local level. We centered our analysis on five core government spending categories in which cost and quality data were readily available: healthcare, road transport, primary and secondary education, higher education, and public safety. We then used these estimates to scale across the remaining categories of government spending.",
            "We based our analysis on 2020 government spending data. That year, after accounting for intergovernmental transfers, governments in the United States spent $9.9 trillion, of which approximately 58 percent was at the federal level and the remaining 42 percent was at the state and local level (Exhibit 2).",
            " Of this total, about 42 percent was either unspecified or could not be further optimized in terms of operations, such as paying interest on debt or Social Security payments. This type of spending was excluded because it is not related to efficiency of production but is more commonly related to policy effectiveness, which was not in the scope of this article. As a result, our analysis focused on $2.3 trillion of government spending at the federal level and $3.5 trillion at the state and local level.",
            " established an approach for estimating the government productivity improvement opportunity.",
            " This approach focuses on operational efficiency and quantifies the opportunity based on variation in quality and cost per unit.",
            " In this article, we adapted this approach for the United States, analyzing the opportunity at the federal level and at the state and local level.",
            " We broke down spending into six categories: healthcare, road transport, primary and secondary education, higher education, public safety, and âother.â",
            " In 2020, the five core categories (excluding âotherâ) represented 22 percent of federal spending and 62 percent of state and local spending.",
            "We used two methods to estimate the productivity improvement opportunity related to operational efficiency for each core category. We began by estimating cost per unit, which was equal to spending divided by a given unit. For each stateâs costs, we normalized for wage differences. To do this, we first estimated the ratio of the stateâs average wage to the national average. Because the amount of labor for each category will differ (healthcare tends to use more labor, while transport likely uses less), we assumed labor was half of costs and therefore applied half of the wage difference. In addition, a different denominator unit was used for each core category, such as enrolled student body in higher education and total lane miles for road transport.",
            "For the second method, we added a quality metric to the output measure, such as six-year graduation rates for higher education or violent-crime rates for public safety.",
            " For state and local spending, data constraints limited us to only state-level metrics, but we applied them to local spending as well.",
            "The following are the methods we used to arrive at the estimates reported in Exhibit 3:",
            "The âotherâ category accounted for 38 percent of state and local spending and 78 percent of federal spending. We excluded unspecified areas or areas that could not be further optimized in terms of operations. This represented 47 percent and 78 percent of the âotherâ category, respectively. Examples of this spending included state and local insurance trust expenditures and interest on debt.",
            "For the remaining portion of the âotherâ category, we associated each subcategory with one of the five core categories based on how closely they might be related. Examples of these subcategories included utilities and sewerage.",
            " The core categoryâs productivity improvement opportunity percentage was then applied to the subcategoryâs spending.",
            "To understand operational challenges the US government may be facing in capturing this opportunity, we used another published framework that addresses how to improve public-sector productivity across five operational focus areas: ability to experiment, ability to sunset outdated infrastructure, existence of feedback loops, existence of incentives for goods or services improvement, and existence of budget constraints for consumers.",
            " For each operational focus area, there are several improvement interventions that government leaders can pursue based on our experience with public-sector organizations. For each of these, we estimated net savings based on observed organizational results. Interventions were then grouped against operational focus areas, and the total net potential savings were estimated. This provided a perspective on the relative importance of a given operational focus area, based on the previously deployed operational framework that we used (Exhibit 4).",
            "The methods used to measure the productivity improvement opportunity related to operational efficiency have limitations. First, the approach quantifies the opportunity based on variation due to efficiency of production, not need. For example, if two states have different rates of obesity, the need for healthcare spending will inherently be different. As a result, it may not estimate what the âappropriateâ amount of spending should be. In addition, this approach does not account for structural differences between states. The approach assumes each state can reach the cost per unit of another state. However, if, for example, it costs more per lane mile for a rural location than an urban location, a state like Alaska may never reach the same level of efficiency as a state like Rhode Island. We attempted to adjust for part of this discrepancy through the wage index normalization. In the next article of this series, we will dig deeper into ways to address these limitations as we focus on how to operationalize productivity improvement opportunities.",
            "We then estimated that the US government productivity improvement opportunity is $725 billion to $765 billion, adjusting for wage differences across states (see sidebar âHow we measured the US government productivity improvement opportunityâ). About 60 percent of the total was at the state and local level, with nearly a third of the opportunity in healthcare and about 15 percent in primary and secondary education. Of the remaining 40 percent at the federal levelâ$285 billion to $295 billionâabout 50 percent of the opportunity was in healthcare (Exhibit 3).",
            "We also sought to offer insight on how government leaders could capture the productivity improvement opportunity. To do so, we used a previously developed operational framework that lays out how the public sector could pursue productivity improvements (Exhibit 4).",
            "At its core, the framework seeks to identify challenges related to an organizationâs ",
            " to improve compared with its ",
            " to improve. We found that more than 60 percent of the opportunity was tied to an organizationâs ability to improve. There are two important operational focus areas. The first is an organizationâs ability to experiment, which allows organizations to implement interventions such as improving processes and optimizing governance. The second is the ability to sunset outdated infrastructure, a tactic that is being employed across industries today with tools such as artificial intelligence. The inability to do this can, for example, prevent the better use of IT and automation.",
            "An organizationâs motivation to improve accounts for the remaining 40 percent or so of the opportunity. The largest operational focus area, representing more than 60 percent of the motivation opportunity, is associated with feedback loops. This refers to government organizations receiving feedback on their goods or services from consumers. Proven interventions include enhancing consumer experience, which is rapidly expanding in adoption across the public sector.",
            "Another operational focus area related to motivation is the existence of incentives for goods or services improvement by employees. In this case, example interventions include hiring the right talent or aligning leadership on organizational outcomes.",
            "A third motivation-related operational focus area is how to overcome a lack of budget constraints for consumers. In many cases, consumers have no choice but to deal with a government organization, such as when obtaining or renewing a driverâs license. Unlike other purchasing choices, such as trading off between how much food or entertainment to purchase, these government products and services are necessities, creating no motivation to improve. Reframing the consumerâs budget from cash to another metric, such as time, can generate this motivation, such as providing faster self-service options for renewing a driverâs license.",
            "For many years, policy makers, organizational leaders, and researchers have discussedâand often largely dismissedâcapturing productivity improvements in government. Using a definition and approach focused on operational efficiency, we estimated a potential $725 billion to $765 billion opportunity. We found that more than 60 percent of the opportunity could be captured by providing organizations with a greater ability to improve; the remainder could be captured from motivation. In the remaining articles in this series, we will break down the roles that government plays to better identify approaches on how to improve productivity at the organizational level.",

            "Many leading organizations have been able to rapidly attract and hire needed talent by focusing on four critical components of the hiring process: expanding the candidate pipeline, sharpening job descriptions\nand employer branding, streamlining the hiring process, and enabling data-based decision making.",
            "Each of these actions can help close talent gaps, but they are especially effective when used together.",
            "Creatively reassessing and changing candidate screening criteria can expand sourcing pipelines, ultimately increasing the number of qualified potential candidates who may be considered for a role. These changes could include strategically seeking out new types of candidates, such as those switching jobs midcareer or reentering the workforce after time away; candidates from different geographic locations or remote workers; candidates from diverse demographics or backgrounds; or skilled-through-alternative-routes (STAR) candidates, who are adults in the workforce over the age of 25 who have high school diplomas but do not have bachelorâs degrees.",
            "There are nearly 70 million STAR candidates in the United States, composing approximately 50 percent of the workforce. Despite not holding bachelorâs degrees, these individuals have developed skills through workforce training, boot camps or certificate programs, military service, or on-the-job experiences. Because a rÃ©sumÃ© screener may automatically exclude these candidates due to their lack of formal educational credentials, expanding screening criteria to include STAR candidates could vastly expand the pool of qualified job applicants.

            ", more than 40 percent of respondents cited meaningful work as one of the top reasons why they wanted to stay in their current position.",
            " Organizations could develop and implement surveys or hold focus groups\nfor potential job candidates as well as for current employees to understand what these groups value in their roles and employers. This information can then be used to redesign job descriptions and employer\nbranding to crystallize and clearly communicate aspects of a role that candidates care about, thereby attracting more applicants.",
            "In recent years, the average time from a candidate applying to a public sector job to receiving a job offer was about 119 daysâmore than triple the private-sector average.",
            " To condense this lengthy process without compromising outcomes, public sector organizations can rapidly analyze their current-state hiring processes to understand the most salient pain points. These data can help inform the redesigning of\nhiring processes to, for example, simplify application requirements, minimize handoffs between teams, and strategically time security-screening procedures to reduce time to hire and improve the candidate\nexperience. Organizations could also create greater transparency into the hiring process for candidates via more proactive communications or by creating a calendar of hiring milestones and expectations.",
            "Underpinning all other steps in improving hiring processes is enabling data-based decision making across recruiting and hiring activities. This can be achieved by standing up dashboards that are used to drive day-to-day operational decisions. Such dashboards provide visibility into current process bottlenecks, which allows for attention and action to be directed where it is most needed, ultimately resulting in improved talent attraction and hiring efforts for many public sector entities.",
            "Across sectors, data transparency enables organizations to quickly progress hiring by shedding light on where efficiencies can be swiftly realized (for example, where candidates are getting stuck in existing hiring processes). Deploying dashboards that serve as a single source of truth on organizational recruiting and hiring has proven critical for companies; they are core to any effort to close talent gaps.",
            "The four steps above can significantly transform the efficacy of hiring. But implementing themâand doing so quickly and efficiently to close talent gapsâis not easy for any organization, especially for those with dispersed internal recruiting and hiring teams that do not coordinate regularly or that lack readily available hiring data. In the public sector, these challenges are particularly pronounced because the structures of many public sector organizations do not allow for the focus and cross-functional collaboration required to implement these efforts tactfully, nor do they have dedicated teams to execute these changes. As such, many organizations in both the private and public sectors have set up data-enabled talent win rooms to orchestrate and accelerate the implementation of these steps to rapidly close talent gaps.",
            "Four steps can significantly transform the efficacy of hiring. But implementing them is not easy for any organization.",
            "Data-enabled talent win rooms include three fundamental characteristics.",
            " The cross-functional team brings together the stakeholders needed to hire talent quickly. This core group is made up of members from human resources, such as recruiters and hiring specialists; business functions, such as hiring managers; and subject matter experts, such as personnel security and IT professionals. The dedicated talent win room team works together to help candidates progress quickly through the hiring process by minimizing handoff delays between teams and expediting alignment to hire candidates. This swift stakeholder coordination can greatly reduce the time required to complete critical hiring activities, resulting in more talent in the door when it is needed.",
            " A central data repositoryâand, ideally, a set of dashboards that uses the central data to showcase hiring goals and progressâhelps aggregate information on hiring across the organization. Data shown could include actual hiring versus planned hiring, the number of candidates at each stage of the hiring pipeline, and vacancy requests filed from the business to the human-capital office. These data can be used to inform hiring planning, drive recruiting and hiring strategies, and deliver a clear picture of current hiring successes and gaps.",
            " Using an iterative working model supported by agile ways of workingâincluding daily check-ins, weekly planning, and biweekly retrospective assessmentsâcan ensure continuous hiring progress. By working in this manner, the talent win room can rapidly identify bottlenecks to hiring and determine the right interventions needed to accelerate solutions. The data-enabled talent win room team can then rapidly deploy these interventions and measure their impact, adjusting as data show which interventions yield the greatest impact. This approach allows for a rapid, data-informed operating model of continuous testing, learning, and adapting.",
            "The characteristics and operating models of data-enabled talent win rooms create organizational capacity to transform hiring by bringing together the data and expertise necessary to make quick and sound hiring decisions. Their impact has been demonstrated repeatedly within organizations of different types, sizes, and locations.",
            "For example, one large US federal agency created a fiscal-year hiring goal that was more than 50 percent higher than the total number of hires they were able to make in the previous fiscal year. To accomplish\nthis goal, the agency set up a data-enabled talent win room to develop executive and operational dashboards that provided visibility into hiring progress and barriers. The cross-functional team could then strategically reduce bottlenecks for hiring critical roles. These efforts allowed the agency to increase its hiring rate by more than 30 percent in the first three months after establishing the data-enabled talent win room.",
            "At a different US federal agency, candidates, hiring managers, and HR specialists reported numerous pain points throughout the hiring process, such as candidates saying the hiring process was delayed and not transparent. The agency explored solutions from a customer-centric approach and subsequently piloted changes through a data-enabled talent win room. Metrics of success, such as process timelines and candidate experience feedback, were rigorously tracked, and a cross-functional team worked together to ensure rapid progress. As a result, the time to hire decreased by nearly 80 percent, and the team within the agency\nthat implemented the data-enabled talent win room efforts saw a more than sevenfold net gain in hiring numbers in that fiscal year.",
            "Data-enabled talent win rooms have also been used successfully in public sector organizations outside the United States. For example, a G-20 ministry was undergoing a major transformation to digitalize its\nservices, which required elevating organizational capabilities to attract, select, and cultivate top tech talent. However, the agency had nascent knowledge of tech talent needs and a recruiting process that took up to six months. By using a data-enabled talent win room, the agency was able to attract the talent it needed to power its transformation, reducing time to hire by 65 percent, quintupling its monthly interview capacity, and developing more than 15 recruiting partnerships with academic institutions and technology communities across the country. The data-enabled talent win room helped the department deliver results faster while retaining and growing talent. In turn, the department won a national award for client experience.",
            "A robust, qualified, and motivated public sector workforce is critical to drive complex initiatives that affect society. Using data-enabled talent win rooms to implement the four steps described above has been shown to be key in closing labor gaps in any type of organization, but they are especially beneficial to government organizations that face steep hiring gaps and often have limited organizational capacity to close them.",
            "The meaningful nature of public sector work is widely valued by both prospective and existing employees, offering a unique competitive advantage when recruiting and hiring. However, the sector still faces steep, persistent attraction and hiring challenges. Using data-enabled talent win rooms to combat these challenges can help quickly and effectively fill the sectorâs growing number of open critical roles with qualified and motivated candidates. The accelerated hiring of candidates into these critical government roles can help speed up the many important public sector initiatives that benefit all citizens.",

        "description": "Women are better represented in the US public and social sectors than in corporations. But these sectors lag behind others in areas that could make it hard to recruit and retain tomorrow’s women leaders.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " in the US workplace, the public sector continues to have a clear edge over corporations. However, new McKinsey research finds that governmental organizations may struggle to keep leading the way toward gender parity. The latest edition of our annual ",
            " report reveals that the public sector lags private-sector organizations in critical areas that could help curb burnout and attrition among women managers.",
            " But there are steps leaders can take to shore up support for women in management roles to ensure the civil services continue to attract and retain the talented women the nation needs.",
            "A joint effort by McKinsey and LeanIn.Org, our 2022 report surveyed more than 40,000 people across more than 300 organizations to find out how women across the identity spectrum are faring in all levels of the workplace.",
            " In line with previous years, our latest survey found that women are better represented in public- and social-sector talent pipelines than their private-sector counterparts. But there is still work to be done. While women of color (WOC) are better represented at every level of the public sector compared with private organizations, they still occupy a smaller share of civil-service roles than White women, especially at the midmanager level. And although women are close to or above parity from the entry level to the senior vice president (SVP) level in the public sector, they remain underrepresented at the top of the talent pipeline, such as in the secretaryâs or governorâs office and in legislature or oversight roles.",
            "Our latest survey showed another troubling trend: the unprecedented burnout rate among women leaders seen in 2021 has continued to worsen, with our latest survey recording the highest rates of attrition for women leaders since the report launched in 2015.",
            "Even though the public sector has better representation for women compared with the private sector, it underperforms in crucial areas, including setting manager expectations, training managers, and offering career development programs such as mentoring and sponsorship. Failure to deliver on these table stakes policies could be fueling greater burnout and attrition of managers and women at all levels.",
            "In this article, we take a deeper dive into ",
            " to examine where the public-sector talent pipeline diverges from that of the private sector. We also explore the opportunities to continue to grow the public and social sectorsâ position as a front-runner in womenâs representation in the workforce, with a focus on better supporting managers.",
            "A deeper dive into the latest ",
            " research reveals several noteworthy trends (Exhibit 1).",
            "Since launching in 2015, the ",
            " report has tracked progress toward eliminating the so-called âbroken rungââthe lower rates of promotion for women from entry-level to managerial positions. Lower promotion rates cascade down the pipeline, making it difficult for organizations to lay a foundation for sustained progress at more senior levels.",
            "In the overall workforce, the broken rung has persisted every year since we launched ",
            ". Across all sectors in 2022, for every 100 men who were promoted, 87 women and just 82 women of color were promoted. A more granular breakdown reveals that for every 100 men who were promoted, only 75 Latinas were promoted. Rates were lower still for Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Indigenous women.",
            "However, our 2022 report also found that women in the public and social sectors saw higher promotion rates than men: 107 women for every 100 men promoted. By contrast, only 87 women in the overall workforce were promoted for every 100 men. WOC in government saw a promotion rate from entry level to manager of 4.2 percent compared with 1.6 percent for all women. These findings indicate that while the public and social sectors make up a small proportion of all industries, they are setting a higher standard on the promotion to manager relative to other sectors. While this is an encouraging trend, it is important to note that WOC are starting from a point of lower representation in entry-level roles.",
            "Other key shifts emerged in our 2022 survey compared with the previous year.",
            "First, the share of women being hired in the public and social sectors is now higher than for all sectors at all tenure levels. However, a larger share of women than men in the public and social sectors were internal hires across all levels except in SVP and C-suite roles. This is important to highlight because such internal hiring may spread around representation without increasing the aggregate.",
            "Second, our latest survey saw a significant increase in womenâs representation in the public and social sectors in cabinet and department leader roles, from 41 percent in 2021 to 53 percent in 2022 (compared with 28 percent of women in equivalent roles across all sectors in 2022). This shift likely reflects the Biden administrationâs focus on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA),",
            " which has encouraged increased representation and more appointments of women leaders, particularly WOC.",
            " all sectors are deciding to leave their organizations because of three primary factors.",
            "Women leaders want a better work culture and are more than 1.5 times as likely as men at their level to have left a previous job for an organization with greater commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). This is not a new phenomenon. A 2021 McKinsey article showed that many people, especially parents,",
            " are no longer willing to stick it out at a job that doesnât offer flexibility and benefits.",
            "Working in a remote or hybrid environment may offer a reprieve from bias. But this is not a substitute for systemic change. Organizations need to invest in creating a truly inclusive culture and cannot rely on remote and hybrid work as a solution. Hence, it is important to create spaces where women, whether working remotely or in person, can grow and feel empowered.",
            "Forty percent of women leaders say their DEI work isnât acknowledged at all in performance reviews, yet they are two times more likely to be driving the activities than men. While role modeling, championing, and advocating for healthy boundaries can help normalize workplace flexibility and foster a more inclusive environment, women who do so risk being penalizedâthat is, being overlooked for promotions.",
            "Women leaders are also still overworked at home, which may be contributing to higher burnout rates. The ",
            " report found that women in senior management are four times more likely than men at their level to be responsible for their familyâs housework and caregiving, while women in entry-level roles are twice as likely as men at that level to carry this responsibility.",
            "Meanwhile, two-thirds of women under 30 say they would be more interested in advancing if they saw a senior leader with the workâlife balance they wanted.",
            "Women leaders face stronger headwinds in their day-to-day experiences than men. Women leaders are two times more likely to be mistaken for someone at a more junior level than men leaders (26 percent versus 13 percent). Women leaders are ten percentage points more likely to have had a coworker get credit for their idea than men leaders (37 percent versus 27 percent). Finally, women leaders are more likely to report that personal characteristics, such as their gender or parenthood status, have played a role in being denied or passed over for a raise or promotion.",
            "Third, our 2022 survey found that while attrition of senior leaders has increased significantly across all sectors for both women and men, the gap between men and women is at its largest since we began the survey. For every woman promoted to the next level, two women directors chose to leave their organizationâthe highest rate of attrition relative to the average from 2017 to 2021 (Exhibit 2). Although attrition rates were lower at most levels in the public and social sectors compared with all sectors, they were still higher than the historical average (see sidebar âWhy women leaders are leavingâ).",
            "Although the public and social sectors have led the way in womenâs representation in entry- to midlevel roles since we began our annual survey, these sectors continue to face challenges when it comes to supporting managers.",
            "Supporting and retaining women managers sets up the next generation of women leaders for success, and can therefore help compensate for the increased attrition rates in senior women observed in our latest survey. By contrast, a lack of support for women in management roles can diminish the impact of mending the broken rung and hinder the recruitment and retention of younger, entry-level women (see sidebar âCurrent public-sector hiring challengesâ). Indeed, manager support was one of the top five factors younger women across all sectors cited when considering whether to leave their jobs. Other primary factors included opportunity to advance; flexibility; company commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); and company commitment to employee well-beingâattributes that managers play a critical role in encouraging.",
            " has long faced greater hiring challenges than the private sector. The inability to easily change compensation levels introduces yet another hurdle in an area of high inflation.",
            "For every three government jobs available in February 2023, only one was filled. And as of March 2023, nearly 62 percent of public-sector job vacancies remained unfilled, relative to roughly 33 percent in the private sector.",
            " The government has relatively high overall job vacancies: nearly 1.0 million in March 2023,",
            " compared with about 8.5 million for the entire private sector. If these trends continue, workloads for public- and social-sector employees could increase if womenâs attrition rates keep growing.",
            "When managers are supported in their efforts to recruit and retain top talent, women in particular benefit across several dimensions that influence their experience in their jobs, including advancement opportunities, psychological safety, and work culture (Exhibit 3). But our survey revealed there is a growing gap between whatâs expected of managers and how theyâre being trained and rewarded to deliver on those expectations (Exhibit 4).",
            "Based on the overall findings of our latest report, weâve identified three steps leaders can take to support manager development and close this gap across all sectors (including government) and, in doing so, encourage the retention of women, and others, at all levels.",
            "Expectations for managers have been increasing over the past two years. In addition to their traditional responsibilities, they are now often running DEI for their organizations and managing hybrid teams (see sidebar âYoung women and diversity, equity, and inclusionâ). Managers are also increasingly expected to support employee well-being, including helping employees maintain a sustainable workload.",
            " young women can help organizations build diverse and inclusive teams. Younger women are more likely than their older counterparts to be women of color and to identify as LGBTQ+. Young women are also more likely to actively practice allyship at work than more mature employees and young men. Retaining young women and advancing them to senior roles could help organizations reverse trends in burnout, unmanageable workloads, and employee well-being. At more senior levels, Black women, LGBTQ+ women, and women with disabilities spend up to two times more effort than women overall on diversity, equity, and inclusion work outside their formal responsibilities.",
            " In addition, Black women in senior roles are more motivated to create a positive workplace and be role models for other Black women.",
            "But training for this new scope of work has not kept up. Sixty-two percent of organizations say they train managers to manage remote employees, but only 46 percent of managers say they receive such training. And while 62 percent of employees felt that managers checked on their personal well-being, far fewer (38 percent) felt their managers went a step further by working to ensure their workloads were manageable. Indeed, 78 percent of organizations expect managers to promote well-being, while only 48 percent train managers on minimizing burnout. This is particularly important for women, half of whom say that having a manageable workload is a signal that a company is committed to employee well-being.",
            "Targeted training could help public-sector managers better support their teams, including women. Topics to consider include proactively supporting employee career development, fostering a sense of inclusion and belonging, managing remote or hybrid employees (setting effective boundaries), facilitating team conversations about diversity issues, combating bias in promotions or everyday interactions, and effectively checking in on employee well-being. The US Office of Personnel Management recently announced that it would provide free, government-wide training to help federal workers improve performance and efficiency when serving in hybrid work environments. Such actions are positive examples of how the government is beginning to prioritize these topics more.",
            "Women employees could benefit if organizations expanded the scope of sponsorship programs. Unlike mentorship, which focuses on giving advice, answering questions, and strategizing about an employeeâs career and professional development, sponsorship connects an employee to people, opportunities, and networks that directly help advance their careers.",
            "Targeted sponsorship programs could make a significant impact on womenâs careers, especially those of WOC. For example, Black and Asian women often donât have strong allies on their team advocating on their behalf for increased pay or highlighting their accomplishments. Because of biases in performance evaluations, women and WOC often receive lower performance ratings and are given vague, unspecific feedback that hinders their ability to advance.",
            " Having a sponsor who vouches for their performance, challenges biases, and connects them to a larger network could help women advance in their careers and feel more supported in the workplace.",
            "For public-sector managers, this means finding time to connect with more-junior colleagues and being more intentional, specifically about the type of support provided to women within the organization. Public-sector leaders could also consider incorporating building sponsorship relationships into managersâ evaluations and training.",
            "Virtually all organizations build business goals into managersâ performance reviews, but very few do the same for metrics related to people management and DEI. This is an incomplete, but easily fixable, view of performance. Women managers could especially benefit from refined performance evaluations because they tend to invest more in people management and DEI than men in the same roles. Including this type of work in performance reviews would make it more likely that women managers would be recognized for their efforts.",
            " This in turn could lead to higher performance ratings, faster advancement, and higher pay. Organizations could also implement reviews of manager performance from employees, adding prompts to evaluation forms to gather more nuanced input.",
            "Indeed, one federal agency has already incorporated a DEIA goal into its Senior Executive Service (SES) performance targets, part of a broader implementation strategy to make every SES accountable for driving these initiatives.",
            "In addition, many organizations track attrition rates, promotion rates, and other career outcomes, as well as conduct surveys to measure employee satisfaction and well-being. Insights from these processes could be built into public-sector managersâ performance evaluations. Leaders could also consider more clearly sharing their expectations and rewarding results. Sharing well-being and diversity metrics or publicly acknowledging managers who go above and beyond for their employees could be useful in boosting manager morale and motivation. Public-sector entities could also consider evaluating managers on managing employee career development and managing team morale and retention.",
            "At all levels, womenâs representation in the public and social sectors is higher than in corporate America. However, women leaders across all sectors are leaving at unprecedented rates, largely because they feel unsupported and overlooked in the workplace. By doubling down on improving managersâ experiences and their ability to support their coworkers, the public sector could build on its success with womenâs representation. Because when managers show up, everyone benefitsâespecially women.",

That difficulty makes it harder for them both to articulate their performance to boards and other stakeholders and to evolve their operating models strategically so that they can navigate current and future challenges.",
            "Art institutions were struggling with the resilience of their operating models heading into the COVID-19 pandemic because of increasing overheads, changing audience behaviors, and shifts in fundersâ priorities. The disruptions triggered by the pandemic only compounded these trends. For example, in the United States, research estimates that pandemic-related losses for the performing-arts industry exceeded $3.2 billion, while changing consumer behaviors decreased audience ticket demand by up to 25 percent.",
            " An uncertain economic outlook and high inflation in the wake of the pandemic are exacerbating these pressures. ",
            "Building an effective data collection and analysis program is always challenging. It is even more challenging when you are working in a field that historically has a lack of experience with the power of data.",

            "Â by enabling them to make data-driven decisions. While many art institutions recognize the potential benefits of these tools, they lack the capabilities, processes, and infrastructure to build them. ",
            "To help art institutions get started on the journey to increase their leverage of technology, McKinsey collaborated with seven leading US art institutions to gain insights into how to strengthen their data and analytics practices (see sidebar, âPartner organizationsâ). Our work included the creation of an easy-to-use, objective, and scalable dashboard designed to inform institutional strategy, improve business operations, and establish the proper use of data and analytics within each organization.",
            "Historically, the intrinsic difficulty of measuring the impact of art institutions has limited the use of standardized performance measures among them. As a result, such organizations often have an imprecise understanding of their audiences, short-term perspectives on revenue and growth prospects, and planning methods often set up in reaction to unreliable patterns of arts funding. These problems have aggravated the struggles that many institutions have faced following the ",
            ". ",
            "Our work sought to create a standardized methodology and dashboard that addressed these challenges and could scale across institutions, serving as a launch pad for further investments in improving the resilience of art institutions through data and analytics. Our shared-design methodology recognized that what constituted success would vary by institution. Thus, our focus was on helping each institution better assess its growth trajectory, match performance with aspirations, and, ideally, learn and exchange best practices with peer institutions. ",
            "We studied five measures that we considered essential to assess operational and financial performance: strategic priorities, long-term-performance measures, organizational direction of travel, standardized data sets and analyses, and level of top-management support. Achieving high results in these measures could accelerate the use of data and analytics by a broad range of art organizations, from large, public museums to community theaters. Although diversity, equity, and inclusion and environmental impact issues are strategic priorities for our partner institutions, we didnât include these measures in the inaugural stage of our analysis, because of the need for greater data maturity on these topics.",
            "Many art organizations have developed some internal practices for data management, thanks to their adoption of customer-relationship-management systems. But few standardized metrics exist for assessing overall performance. For example, such management systems should make it possible to determine the number of unique visitors to an institution, yet few organizations have prioritized this data point. Instead, they have focused on the more traditional measure of total attendance. Similarly, few institutions use the same metrics to understand their donor group. Measures of the number of donors, average donation amount, percentage of first-time donors, and percentage of overall donations by the top ten donors are used interchangeably by institutions for this purpose.",
            "[Thereâs a] lack of bandwidth and capabilities to analyze and derive insights from visitor data that the institution is already capturing.",
            "The lack of standardized measures can overwhelm and even derail teams when deciding where to focus their nascent data management practices. A quick way to begin leveraging data and analytics is to focus on high-level institutional priorities and lean into the areas where data are already available. We found that with just 15 data points, we could create insights related to six strategic priorities that our seven partner institutions shared (Exhibit 1). ",
            "Many art institutions determine their performance by assessing changes year over year. But this approach can complicate decision making, given that art organizations regularly experience significant year-over-year volatility in their operations because of events such as a large, one-off gift or an exhibition thatâs a blockbuster. By inadvertently highlighting outlier events, such assessments undermine efforts to use data to inform strategy or benchmark assessments among institutions. ",
            "Measuring longer-term trends, such as CAGR, can help smooth out year-over-year distortions. For this reason, we examined longer-term trends, such as rolling changes over three-year periods, to isolate art organizationsâ underlying performance and reduce volatility. This enabled us to highlight and contextualize multiyear trends related to the institutionsâ strategic priorities, as well as to prioritize the use of existing and readily available data points to facilitate adoption and create familiarity with the process. ",
            "In our field, we sometimes give up too easily on new initiatives because they donât show a quick ROI. It is critical when investing in and assessing big projects to let them fully develop.",
            "Additionally, it takes art institutions longer than it might for other types of organizations to make sustained changes, including developing new talent, changing the course of programming, and influencing audience perception. A major exhibition can take up to three years to plan, including the negotiation of artwork loans, institutional partnerships, temperature-controlled installation, and the production of associated publications. Orchestra performances require arranging for and managing rehearsals, guest conductors, and players. Analyzing events over a three- to five-year time frame therefore enabled a more accurate and strategic measure of where an institution was headed and a reflection on how years of strategic actions had influenced outcomes.",
            "There are few uniformly agreed-upon standards for assessing the performance of art institutions. For example, increased attendance may not necessarily be a good thing, as some institutions deliberately limit attendance to maintain the quality of the visitor experience. Similarly, a significant increase in profits could be viewed as a missed opportunity to have invested in the institutionâs noncommercial activities.",
            "We donât execute educational programs with hopes that people will buy tickets in ten years. We hope it will immediately provide lasting value to the community.",
            "In the absence of standardized performance assessments in nonprofit environments, we focused our analyses on capturing an art institutionâs trajectory on topics of strategic importance. The analyses were designed to help generate insights on key questions, such as the following:",
            "To help answer these questions, we designed our analyses to look at the difference between the CAGRs of two data points. This technique shed light on each institutionâs underlying trajectory on these strategic topics while recognizing that the answer didnât represent positive or negative performance. ",
            "For example, operating revenues growing faster than attendance could reflect efficient ticket sales for events that required payment. If they grew more slowly than attendance did, it could be a signal that the institution had prioritized free events for the public to drive community engagement. Similarly, if operating revenues grew more quickly than head count did, it could be because of a degree of organizational efficiency. Slower operating-revenue growth relative to head count could be because new hires were prioritized to accommodate audiences after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "Benchmarking performance against peers can reveal valuable insights. This practice is more mature among commercial entities than among art organizations. While all our partner institutions supported performance benchmarking, agreeing on the necessary data sets to invest in was complex because of key differences in how each institution measured audience engagement and business operations.",
            "Each institution has a unique mission and a distinctive manner of fulfilling that mission, depending on the needs of its audience. This makes it complicated for any group of institutions to align on standardized data points. Generous ad hoc data-sharing relationships do exist between specific institutions, but the lack of high-quality, up-to-date, and standardized data sets places limits on the perspectives that art-institution leaders can have of their organizationsâ performance.",
            "We need to understand common financial benchmarks to better assess financial performance in the face of crises and uncertainty.",

            "âorganize data-collecting and -sharing programs for the sector. Participation in these programs is voluntary, and the completeness and quality of the data are difficult for the industry groups to certify. As a result, art institutions are often guarded in how much they invest in or leverage such data sets.",
            "To unlock the potential value of data and analytics for our partner institutions, we invested significant effort in the standardization and quality control of data points. To sustain that value over the longer term, art institutions may need to consider sharing data among themselves in a more systematic way.",
            "In our project, we focused on developing a data dashboard for executives, trustees, and external stakeholders that would inform institutional strategy (Exhibit 2). But setting up a dashboard is only one aspect of the process. Equally important is an organizational mindset thatâs both creative and analyticalâand that mindset starts at the top.",
            "Art institutions are more likely to be successful with data and analytics if they adopt the best practices of for-profit organizations when it comes to measuring performance. This includes securing executive-level alignment on investing in data and analytics, implementing these tools for the long term, and relying on the insights that these tools generate to set overall institutional direction. At a more granular level, a senior leader needs to be responsible for maintaining the dashboard and ensuring that the data are up to date and of high quality. ",

            " These measures had a substantial impact on the entire US healthcare ecosystem, helping to stimulate testing and vaccination efforts, expand coverage and access to care, and support providers as they faced unprecedented challenges.",
            "More than three years later, with the public health emergency expiring, much of the funding and flexibility that helped expand testing, vaccination, coverage, and access to care is also coming to an end (see table). The current administration has announced plans to end the PHE on May 11, 2023.",
            " Although Congress has recently extended certain accommodations through 2024 (for example, Medicare telehealth flexibilities and the Acute Hospital Care at Home program), the federal government is set to continue phasing out a majority of the funding and regulatory support initiatives currently in place, with many expiring concurrent with the end of the PHE. Also ending is a provision that had increased federal funding by 6.2 percent to provide incentives for state Medicaid agencies to keep individuals enrolled in the program (forgoing eligibility redeterminations). While redeterminations and increased federal funding were previously tied to the PHE, Congress is now allowing states to redetermine Medicaid eligibility as of April 2023 (states have some flexibility with when to start), and it is gradually reducing the additional funding throughout 2023.",

            "The federal government implemented a wide range of COVID-19 pandemic interventions, from vaccination, testing, treatment, and access to care delivery and healthcare coverage. In total, the government spent hundreds of billions of dollarsâincluding more than $30 billion on vaccines,",

            " The US government has also played a role in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, including by developing and providing therapeutics, increasing funding for patient care, and expanding care flexibility. For instance, in the first two months of 2022, the US government provided more than 2.5 million COVID-19 treatments and therapies to US states.",

Providers and payers would also need to negotiate and enter contracts to directly procure therapeutics from manufacturers and distributors, and prepare for potential cost increases.",
            " To facilitate greater access to care for the US population during the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government supported strained providers by providing financial assistance, staffing and material resources, and flexibility in care delivery models.",
            "Financial assistance came in the form of increased payments, loans, and reduced reimbursement sequestration. Increased payments included the 20 percent diagnosis-related group (DRG) add-on for COVID-19 patients",

            "Finally, the federal government temporarily waived regulations that made it challenging to access care in an era of physical distancing and prevented hospitals from operating at capacity. Medicare coverage was expanded to telehealth services for the first time, and more than 200 waivers and modifications were implemented, including site-of-care and capacity expansions that gave hospitals flexibility in using hospital space.",
            " Additional waivers expanded the scope of practice for non-physicians and loosened hospital reporting requirements.",
            "The uncertain future of government coverage and financial support for care related to COVID-19 may prompt providers and patients to prepare for a greater out-of-pocket burden for such services and treatment. Upon expiration of the PHE, hospitals will no longer receive the 20 percent DRG add-on for COVID-19 patients.",
            " While Medicare coverage of audio-only services for mental health was made permanent, most other telehealth waivers are set to expire at the end of 2024. Of particular importance will be the reduction of site-of-care and workforce flexibility, including expanded scope of practice for non-physicians.",

            " Between January and April 2020, 22 million Americans lost their jobs, and the US unemployment rate surged from 3.5 to 14.8 percent (by July 2022 the US economy had regained the number of jobs lost).",
            " Job losses and furloughs led to losses in employer-sponsored health coverage and the purchasing power to participate in healthcare exchanges.",
            " In response, the federal government intervened to expand coverage and fund governmental programs, including state Medicaid programs. This helped contribute to a historically low uninsured rate of 8.9 percent in the third quarter of 2021.",
            "The federal government intervened in the following ways to increase healthcare coverage throughout the pandemic: protecting Medicaid enrollees from disenrollment through most of the PHE,",
            " opening a special enrollment period for residents of the 36 states that use the US health insurance marketplace to secure health coverage, and providing federal subsidies to offset the cost of COVID-19 care to states (for example, via an additional 6.2 percent in federal medical assistance percentage, or FMAP, for non-expansion populations and 100 percent FMAP for states providing COVID-19-related Medicaid coverage to the uninsured) and to individuals (for example, via premium tax credits through the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Acts).",
            "The 6.2 percent enhanced FMAPâwhich provided approximately $100.4 billion in additional funding to states from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2022âbegan to decrease on April 1, 2023, and will phase out through the rest of the calendar year.",
            " Additionally, the 100 percent FMAP for the 15 states that have opted into providing COVID-19-related Medicaid coverage for the uninsured will end on the last date of the month that the PHE ends.",

            " Faced with rising operating costs and inflation, providers may find the time is right to take on operational efficiency programs to mitigate the additional financial impact of the loss of provider relief funds, loans, and the 20 percent DRG add-on. A reduction in Medicaid enrollment following the restart of Medicaid redeterminations may also affect reimbursement dynamics across some markets. The regulatory landscape will continue to influence provider investment decisions as many systems seek to expand ambulatory and telehealth service offerings. Telehealth has spurred huge consumer uptake and provider investment already.",
            " Congress recently extended many of the Medicare telehealth flexibilities and the Hospital Without Walls waiver through 2024.",
            " However, other related practitioner eligibility expansions are set to expire with the end of the PHE, which may affect providersâ ability to leverage alternative care settings for their patients. In a tight healthcare labor market, it is particularly important for providers to prepare for the rollback of site-of-care and workforce flexibilities (such as expanded scope of practice for non-physicians).",
            " Private payers will be required to absorb the costs of COVID-19 vaccination, testing, and treatment that were previously shouldered by the federal government. A likely increase in claim volume related to treatment, testing, and vaccination stresses the importance of use management efforts, particularly in the context of ongoing COVID-19 waves. Payers may also see higher costs related to vaccine administration. Finally, with the drop in Medicaid enrollment related to the resumption of Medicaid redeterminations,",
            " private payers on the exchanges should prepare for a potential increase in enrollment. An estimated one-third of beneficiaries no longer eligible for Medicaid will qualify for subsidies on the exchanges.",
            " Manufacturers of COVID-19-related products will face uncertainty in demand as federal prepurchasing recedes and the regulatory climate reverts to pre-EUA requirements. Manufacturers that manage large federal contracts may need to prepare to juggle a higher number of smaller contracts (for example, with health systems and retail pharmacies) to maintain production levels. Manufacturers may also shift to seasonal production of COVID-19 supplies (the US Food and Drug Administration has suggested shifting boosters to a schedule similar to the flu shot)",
            " and pursue expansion into international markets if domestic demand remains unpredictable. The end of large-scale federal advance purchasing of COVID-19 products such as tests and vaccines could affect the countryâs healthcare industrial base. Manufacturers will run the risk of having insufficient dedicated manufacturing capacity in the event of a potential future surge, which could lead to downstream public health consequences.",
            " Waning federal involvement could have a more direct impact on companies involved in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, tests, and therapeutics than on other stakeholders. For example, health systems and pharmacies have had ongoing involvement in purchasing therapeutics and tests (particularly rapid tests). Distributors may now need to identify and secure contracts with manufacturers, hospitals, and pharmacies to take over the governmentâs previous role in provisioning products. At the same time, traditional distribution channels will likely be sufficient to deliver these products to consumers in a postpandemic era, assuming volume remains relatively predictable and care shifts back to traditional settings from, for example, vaccination drives at stadiums.",
            "Since the COVID-19 public health emergency was declared in January 2020, the US government has invested trillions of dollars in public health and stimulus packages and implemented an unprecedented number of regulatory flexibilities to expand testing, vaccination, coverage, and access to care while supporting providers. As the public health emergency comes to an end, along with many corresponding funding and regulatory flexibilities, stakeholders have an opportunity to make strategic plans, respond quickly and decisively, and succeed in the new environment.",

            " has long enjoyed a reputation for being a good hedge against inflation, yet even industry veterans might be hard-pressed to explain exactly why. Has it delivered better real (inflation-adjusted) returns during inflationary periods than at other times? Has it outperformed other asset classes during inflationary periods? With inflation at 40-year highs, we decided to perform a data analysis of CREâs inflation-hedging attributes. Our goal: a definitive answer to whether CRE deserves its golden reputation and a sense of how it might perform this time around.",
            "The answer to the first question is yes: CRE has helped investors retain real value during periods of heightened inflation. According to McKinseyâs analysis, CRE outperformed inflation, its own historical average, and other asset classes (including stocks, bonds, and gold) during most of the last seven periods of elevated inflation. However, thereâs a wrinkle in the data that contradicts accepted wisdom: CRE performed this way despite rents generally ",
            " keeping up with inflation.",
            "The principal reason CRE has served well as an inflation hedge",
            " is that in periods of higher inflation, capitalization ratesâeffectively, the net operating income (NOI) yield investors are willing to acceptâhave tended to compress. While interest rates typically rise in periods of inflation, cap rate spreads often narrow. This counterintuitive finding is perhaps partly the result of widespread belief in real estateâs inflation-hedging properties: investors put money into asset classes they believe will protect real value.",
            "Understanding how cap rates have contributed to CREâs inflation-hedging identity is particularly pertinent to modeling potential outcomes for the asset class today. Thatâs because currently, amid the fastest monetary tightening on record, cap rate trajectories may differ substantially from those of past inflationary periods. As the macroeconomic panorama evolves, owners contemplating operating, refinancing, or selling existing assets, as well as investors considering new opportunities, can benefit from understanding the following dynamics:",
            "Following losses induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, CRE returns have partially rebounded along with inflation, despite continued softness in the office market. But real risks could be introduced by persistently high inflation and interest rates, the rising cost and declining availability of debt, and possible economic contractionâall of which may lead to cap rate expansion. To prepare, real estate players can start by arming themselves with a fresh understanding of an old piece of industry wisdom.",
            "During the seven inflationary periods from 1980 to 2022,",
            " CRE returns, at 11.7 percent annualized, have generally outperformed inflation, their own historical average, and other asset classes, including the S&P 500 and BBB corporate bonds (exhibit). More specifically, CRE outperformed inflation in six of the seven inflationary periods and outperformed its own historical average in five of them. The asset class outperformed stocks in four of the seven periods, and bonds in six of them. Real estate broadly has been a useful hedge against inflation.",
            "In every period, at least one CRE sectorâmultifamily, office, retail, or industrialâbeat inflation. And in six of the seven inflationary periods, the periodâs top-performing sector outperformed both stocks and bonds. Picking the right sector based on fundamentals, for those with the foresight to do it, has been a great investment relative to other options in the same time periods.",
            "Historically, even investors that didnât pick the top-performing sector would have managed to generate real inflation-adjusted returns in most periods. The bottom-performing CRE sector in each inflationary period managed to outperform inflation in six of the seven inflationary periods. The bottom-performing sector also outperformed stocks in four out of seven periods and bonds in five out of seven periods.",
            "Secular trends drove sector outperformance (or underperformance) in each inflationary period. The office sector had standout performances as institutional investment poured into the asset class in the 1980s and again with the dot-com boom in the early 2000s.",
            " Retail outperformed in the early 2000s as big-box retailers transformed the shopping landscape before brick-and-mortar retail came under pressure from e-commerce in the 2010s.",
            " Multifamily generated strong returns in the early 2010s as the millennial generation entered the housing market and a shift away from homeownership fueled rental demand.",
            " For its part, industrial has posted strong returns since the 2010s as the growth of e-commerce has required new-age distribution centers.",
            "A common perception is that CREâs inflation-hedging power comes largely from ownersâ ability to raise rents during inflationary periods. One reason for this perception is that CRE leases protect NOI from inflation in several ways. First, both residential and commercial leases typically reset to market level upon expiration. Second, multiyear commercial leases typically require tenants to pay their proportional share of operating expenses and any future increases. Third, on the retail side, many leases tie a portion of rental income to store revenue, allowing rents to grow with inflation in prices of consumer goods.",
            "However, McKinseyâs analysis reveals that rent growth alone (supported by the aforementioned lease characteristics) has not historically provided a full hedge against inflation. Although rents do tend to increase more quickly during inflationary periods, those increases rarely match the pace of rising inflation point for point. Annualized CRE rent growth averaged only about 3 percent during the seven inflationary periods studied, compared with average annualized inflation of almost 5 percent. Thus, real rents fell.",
            "If rents typically fall behind inflation, then how can CRE deserve its inflation-hedging notoriety? The key factor is cap rate compression, which averaged roughly 20 basis points annually during the periods studied, contributing significantly to total returns. Although the four primary CRE sectorsâoffice, industrial, retail, and multifamilyâand their subcategories serve distinctive purposes in the economy and behave differently in many ways, all sectors have reacted similarly to periods of high inflation: cap rates compressed, and rents rose nominally (but not in real, or inflation-adjusted, terms).\n",
            "Performance throughout much of the current inflationary period has fit the historical pattern. Elevated CRE returns have been accompanied by overall rents growing at a rate lower than inflationâhigher in multifamily and industrial, lower in retail and office. And until recently, cap rates dipped to all-time lows. However, the macroeconomic environment is diverging from the patterns observed in the last seven inflationary periods in ways that could lead to cap rate expansion. Such a scenario could undermine CREâs ability to hedge inflation this time around, and indeed, in recent quarters, CRE returns have fallen.",
            "One notable difference is that six of the previous inflationary periods analyzed occurred during a roughly 40-year period of gradually declining interest rates.",
            " Today, amid monetary tightening that occurred at unprecedented speed,",
            " the cost of debt is rising, and its availability is declining. The vacancy rateâparticularly in the office marketâis another headwind for investors.",
            " And ",

            "It could therefore take some time to arrive at the right economic conditions for a return of cap rate compressionâwhich is, after all, a measure of risk tolerance. With the benefit of falling cap rates in question, building owners will need to work harder to maintain and grow the value of their real asset. ",

Persistent high inflation adds even more pressure to manage building operations and leasing optimally and to acquire, refinance, and execute dispositions strategically. In todayâs macroeconomic environment, it may be wise for owners to consider the following actions.",
            "Investment models should be sensitized to the possibility of persistent inflation and elevated rates. Asset managers can benefit from reworking NOI optimization models to account for higher operating costs. Likewise, property return models can be updated to incorporate a potentially long-term increase in financing costs.",
            "Directing capital expenditures to areas that reduce operating costs is always important but is particularly so during inflationary periods. Some investments, such as in energy-efficient windows and HVAC controls, also can help ",
            ".",
            "In the absence of intervention, real rents fall during inflationary periods. To earn the ability to maintain real rents, smart operators will focus on ",
            ". These might include on-premises meeting spaces in Class A office buildings, which could support tenantsâ flexible work strategies. In apartment communities, busy professionals may willingly pay a premium for amenities such as car charging, dry cleaning, and dog walking.",
            "Inflation should be a factor in decisions related to acquisitions, property development, and dispositions. Owner-operators may benefit from focusing on acquisition and development opportunities in a specific geographic area, so they can build market scale and leverage operating cost efficiencies. Similarly, they could consider selective dispositions of assets in markets that do not support scale.",
            "The conventional wisdom that CRE is a good hedge against inflation is borne out by historical data. But because this hedge is an outcome of cap rate compression, real estate investorsâcurrent and futureâare wise to consider actions tailored to todayâs macroeconomic reality. As costs rise throughout the economy, especially for labor and materials, controlling operating expenses is a key to NOI (even if some cost increases are passed through to tenants) because rent increases tend to lag behind inflation. Knowing how macroeconomic forces have historically affected the sector is important, but thereâs no substitute for taking preemptive action.",

In this unique moment, real estate players should adopt a new mindset: replacing âif you build it, they will comeâ with âif you operate brilliantly and please tenants, they will stay.â In the current market, the success of a real estate investor or operator hinges upon whether they adopt the following six imperatives:",

Our research indicates that in a diversified commercial real estate portfolio, only 10 percent of the assets drive 80 percent of the risks and that some assets (for example, those in markets with a significant renewable-energy industry) actually benefit from the climate transition. Acquiring assets strategically and adding value through decarbonization improvements strengthens portfolios. The ability to generate returns while meeting climate objectives can also help real estate owners access more capital on better terms.",

We have found that the typical path to net zero is net-present-value (NPV) negative. Operators can create positive NPV-net-zero pathways by using analytics at the portfolio level to figure out the right order for implementation, which assets to invest in at what times, and how to link actions at the asset level with strategies for purchasing renewables. Operators can also significantly increase the value of their assets and portfolios by taking additional steps, such as measuring emissions and communicating them to tenants, leveraging scale for better procurement, and incorporating these insights into the investment process.",

Advanced analytics and climate analytics can both confirm experienced-based knowledge and create new insights (Exhibit 5). In one digital-analytics-powered model we built for a US West Coast city, for example, we learned that proximity to a gas station had a negative impact on the growth of rents, but proximity to a high number of five-star Yelp-reviewed restaurants had a strong positive effect on it.",

Large owners in a given market can, for example, centralize leasing teams and give them digital tools that help make value-creating leasing decisions. Owners can also consider consolidating and renegotiating contracts for energy and maintenance services across a portfolioâs properties. With financing costs higher, maintaining high credit ratings, finding low-cost capital, and refinancing regularly will also be necessary to produce returns.",

Itâs a house for people, itâs a house to bring clients to, to bring guests in, itâs a place to do business. Itâs the manifestation of the brand in the physical environment. Everything you look at, everything you hear, smell, taste, touch, is part of JPMorgan Chase and part of that experience. You could say itâs a place to have an experience.",

            "Letâs say I walk into the building for the first time. Whatâs going to strike me as new and innovative?",
            " The minute you see it from the sidewalk, youâre going to feel a lot different. Our building is purposefully lifted off the sidewalk by 100 feet. We didnât have to do that, but we did it to make it more spacious, to welcome the community in, and to give people a feeling of light and air in the middle of the city.",
            "Weâll have a thousand bike racks for people who want to come to work by bicycle. And we have a designated lay-by lane for self-driving cars, so that when that happens, weâre ready for it.",
            "I think one of the things weâve missed in office buildings is that people want to be known. They want to be recognized, they want to be welcomed in the morning, quite frankly, by name. They want to have a personal experience when they come to work, and I think thereâs a great opportunity to do that.",
            "Itâs not much different from when you go into a great restaurant or a great hotel and somebody meets you and they know your name. Theyâve been expecting you. So, technology is really important for knowing when people come in. The way a place smells, quite frankly, is really important to me, and I think itâs important to people. Weâve done lots of due diligence on aromatherapy.",

This is particularly true for younger people who want to learn their craft. Think back on your own career to a great manager or a great coach you had. Those learnings are key.",

We have those spaces connected throughout the building.",
            "The connection, the knowledge transfer, the ability to think out loud with others, is so important. Most creation happens like this. Itâs iteration. Itâs how we got to the moon. Itâs error, correction, error, correction.",

It can be part of it, so we have solutions for hybrid working, we have solutions for people who are at home. We even have parts of the company that work at home full-time. Another portion works at home one or two days a week.

            " When people want to stay home or need to work remotelyâbecause that is where heads-down work is really done wellâweâre going to have tools for them to connect to the office, as if they were there, in a democratic way, in a way in which they still feel the culture, where itâs palpable to them. Thatâs our job: to create workplaces that enable culture and creativity and productivity, maybe happiness even.",
            "I am really excited about virtual reality and augmented reality and their use in distance officing. They help make you feel like youâre together. The tools are not ready to roll out yet, but we are putting all the things in place at 270 Park to use them when they are ready.",
            "The key thing about technology and about thinking through the future of the workplace and the future of work is to make things as flexible and as modular as you can. You have to view buildings and real estate like a machine, a tool, or a lever. You have to build them in such a way that they could be changed for any generation at a reasonable cost, so that buildings donât become antiquated.",
            "If you come into a well-designed office space these days, you really have two planes: a floor plane and a ceiling plane. Everything else on the floor, if you design it correctly, is furniture. The walls are furniture, they come prewired or with glass. Any such furniture can be moved around.",
            " How are you responding to greater demands today for buildings that are healthier, both for residents and for the planet?",
            " We have the largest corporate solar array in the United States. We have a 15-megawatt solar array in Ohio. Five years ago, the leadership of this firm made a commitment to create as much renewable on-site generation as possible. We have been busy for the last five years creating renewable, on-site generation, and weâve experimented with almost every idea. It does come down to solar, wind, and maybe some yet-to-be-discovered battery power that works without burning fossil fuels. All those ideas will be part of 270 Park.",
            "Elevator, security, air handling, sensoring, lighting systems, etceteraâtheyâve been around for the last 70 years. But today, each one of those systems is smarter than itâs ever been. At 270 Park, weâre going take every one of those incredibly smart systems and weâre going to roll them up into a more intelligent way of running a building, a system that is all about automated intelligence, all about learning from itself.",
            "For instance, if it were too hot in here, that shade would come down if it was a certain time of the day. The variable-frequency drive on the fan would engage. There would be more outside air in the room, the lights may be dimmerâall of those systems would work together. This building is also going to have 2.5 times more outside air than any comparable facility that Iâm aware of in the world.",
            "When you come into the building, you may work your way through a security device that knows who you are by facial recognition or by some other biometric marker. And itâll be able to call an elevator just for you. That elevator will know where you like to go in the morningâit might drop you off near a coffee shop in the building. And that coffee shop in the building might know, via your cell phone, that youâre in the vicinity and might make your coffee for you.",
            "We havenât thought about all the ways that a building can be smarter. But the idea of a smart building is kind of passÃ©. Even an intelligent buildingâthose are table stakes. Today, itâs about the intuitive building, and thatâs what weâre working on.",
            "Youâre a global company and many of your stakeholders will never even visit New York City. How is what youâre learning by planning for 270 Park going to benefit them?",
            " We have a community that we call MyWorkplace. Itâs an app, and weâre already using it and making it better. The idea is to create a community. We donât just do this here at 270 Park, weâre doing it worldwide.",
            "Weâre building similar campuses in Bengaluru and Mumbai. We just built campuses in Hyderabad and Manila that have all the same attributes. We built one in Singapore.",
            "Weâre also expanding our retail branches. We went from something like 28 [US] states to having a presence in nearly every state in the nation in just the last three or four years. When we build a new branch, we think about how clients will feel when they come in. We think about how those branches connect to the community. We call many of them community centers, not branches.",

One-third of US consumers (compared with only 26 percent in June 2022) say they feel optimistic about their financial situation; they expect the US economy to improve in the near term. This modest rise in optimism comes in part from their perception of prices: consumers are no longer seeing the massive price hikes that caused them anxiety in 2022 and early 2023. Eighty percent of US consumers (versus only 10 percent in 2022) report seeing stability in the prices of household supplies over the past three months. ",

In this model, pods can include employees from software development, agile coaching, data science, product management, technical program management, and user design/research. The teams are typically empowered to own a customer problem space end to end, set their own objectives and key results, and determine their own product road maps and backlogs.

Product managers have a vast canvas of modern tools and platforms to help serve customers and consumers in new, innovative ways. This capability is particularly important in the consumer retail environment, where offering product experiences that deliver value as well as establish and exceed high user expectations is a true differentiator.",
            "Companies looking to invest in empowered product managers should consider three actions:",
            "Next-generation technology innovation requires a robust underlying tech architecture; however, most companies struggle with legacy systems and usually have more than 20 percent of tech assets in the âtech debtâ category. Moreover, around 60 percent of CIOs have seen tech debt rise in recent years.",
            " At the same time, not all tech debt is bad: modernizing applications adds value, but only up to a point. Consumer companies should prioritize what, how, and when to migrate to a new solution.",
            " ",
            ". A tech stack where all platforms talk to one another is critical. For example, platforms to automate marketing efforts should be able to pull from customer and product databases to personalize messaging and showcase the most attractive items. Failing to integrate these components into a unified tech stack will hinder the potential for technology-driven business improvement.",
            "While certain companies take the more challenging route of leapfrogging to an entirely new tech stack that merges all existing customer and product data, more consumer-facing organizations are likely to take incremental steps. For instance, new business logic can be built out iteratively as modular microservicesâself-contained units of code that execute specific functions with limited dependenciesâeffectively replace the legacy stack. Prioritizing platform upgrades according to the value at stake is important: drawing on our experience in the consumer space, we estimate that 20 to 50 percent of platforms may drive up to 80 percent of the value.",
            "Companies eager to upgrade their platform architecture can gradually switch to a cloud-based approach. Those organizations can then leverage reliable data services and flexibility to adjust capacity while modernizing financial records and other important legacy systems. For instance, one leading European fashion retailer built an automated, cloud-based ",
            "Â that allows fast access to data, along with flexible usage of analytics and isolated AI testing environments. Anheuser-Busch InBev used cloud infrastructure to create ",

            "Companies eager to upgrade their platform architecture can gradually switch to a cloud-based approach.",
            "When upgrading platform architecture, companies can also optimize their systems to power generative AI technologies. In this context, it is critical to choose a suitable model, set up cloud and data architecture, use MLOps to reduce risk and continuously improve the model in production, and run âLive Opsâ to monitor model performance and manage risk.",
            ". This approach helps to deliver high-quality, ready-to-use data sets that people across an organization can easily access and apply to various tasks, such as keeping up with changing customer buying patterns and trends. Traditional approaches, such as grassroots (managing data across the organization on a team-by-team basis) and big bang (managing data en masse in a centralized team), are highly complex and inefficient. In contrast, managing data as a product creates sustainable value by increasing reusability, interoperability, and speed of new application implementation. For example, customer and product data managed as two data products can be connected to drive hyperpersonalization; product and store data can be linked for assortment optimization.",
            "Once an organization manages its data this way, it can more effectively unlock value from it. For instance, building innovative, data-centric applications is one promising vehicle for leveraging existing data in more meaningful ways than simply modernizing existing application features. Generative AI and foundation models now open many new opportunities for data-centric applications by automating content generation based on data. These models essentially supersede much more of the value chain than traditional, discriminative AI models that are used to predict labels or classifications. For example, companies can leverage marketing data and generative AI to automatically create and deliver hyperpersonalized messages with virtually no incremental costs.",
            "Given the rapid pace of tech innovation, consumer and retail companies often find it beneficial to tap into the ecosystem of tech-forward start-ups and supplier partnerships. The attraction is mutual because the retail ecosystem, unlike software, offers tangible products and various services along the value chain. More tech-forward companies also want to be part of a retail ecosystem to access consumers, other retailers, and best-in-class technologies for that complex environment. In addition, consumers appreciate the innovation an ecosystem can provide; seven in ten consumers in a ",

            "For retailers, broader software integration with their supply chain also drives innovative customer experiences. One example is digital additive manufacturingâthat is, 3-D printing. It requires deep software integration between brands and manufacturers across multiple points of the product development and manufacturing life cycle. Investing in such integration can unlock faster time to market and product customization at scale. For example, premium shoe insole developer Superfeet uses 3-D printing machines at various retail outlets to scan customersâ feet and rapidly build custom orthotics that can be delivered within a week, reducing lead time and costs.",

Still, insourcing levels are relatively low; our research indicates the share of outsourced IT talent is 40 to 50 percent in retail and 50 to 60 percent in CPG. Insourcing tends to be more prevalent for critical skills, such as product management and app architecture, and less for commoditized roles, such as product support.",
            "For near-term access to bleeding-edge capabilities outside the organization, companies can employ âacquihiring,â or strategically acquiring digital-native companies to access their technology offerings and talent pools.

            "Another approach is for businesses to establish their own talent ecosystems (for example, launching open-source projects, hosting hackathons, fostering a developer community) or to become part of existing ones created by tech-savvy organizations, thereby harnessing collective knowledge and resources. For example, DÃ¶hler, the natural-ingredient company, joined the SAP Business Network for Logistics to access services and talent from more than 22,000 partners.",
            "In the longer term, companies can attract new talent and differentiate themselves from tech-native companies by focusing on purpose-driven hiring. Consumer companies can distinguish themselves from tech-native enterprises by focusing on the relatability of their brands and the ability for talent to see the tangible impact of their innovations in the marketplace. For example, Nike promotes itself as a company looking to hire âthe most creative people in the worldâ who want to ârevolutionize the future at the confluence of tech and sport.â",

Developing new features was around 50 percent faster, while refactoring authentication was roughly 25 percent faster.",
            "Consumer and retail companies that embark on this software-driven path will likely have to embrace technology as a strategic capability across many dimensions: culture, product management, ecosystems/partnerships, engineering, GTM, and talent.",

For example, one food retailer decided on a âfrontrunnerâ approach, identifying three high-impact areas of one select business unit where it wanted to pioneer changes before rolling them out more broadly in the organization. As a result, the company gained valuable insights to refine its blueprint for operating in the new model. In addition, team members could double as champions for the new model once the changes started to scale across the rest of the business unit and, ultimately, other business units. The approach was so successful that employees from other parts of the organization actively sought to adopt some of the software-centric best practices that the frontrunners had established.",

            ". These efforts are the first steps in the transition to more sustainable operations, and they are intensifying as the companiesâ major end customers establish even more ambitious emissions reduction targets. Intel, for instance, recently committed to net-zero greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions in its global operations by 2040 and has targeted achieving 100 percent use of renewable electricity as an interim milestone in 2030. Since semiconductor companies are often among the suppliers with the greatest emissions, they will face particular scrutiny as end customers increasingly look upstream.",

            ", ",
            ", and Tuisku Suomala, representing the views of McKinseyâs Semiconductors Practice.",
            "As semiconductor companies race to meet supplier expectations, they must broaden their decarbonization efforts. To date, most of their programs have focused on two emissions categories: those directly related to activities within their fabs (Scope 1) and those arising from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling equipment (Scope 2). Since Scope 1 and 2 emissions represent only 65 percent of total GHGs from fabs, companies can only meet their customersâ net-zero goals by expanding their efforts to include Scope 3 upstream emissionsâthose originating from the suppliers that provide services or silicon and other materials for chip manufacturing.",
            "Many semiconductor companies have hesitated to address Scope 3 upstream emissions because of the challenges encountered to date when attempting to create transparency about emissions and drive decarbonization initiatives. The problems largely arise because emissions are fragmented across hundreds of suppliers and thousands of materials. But semiconductor companies may now overcome these hurdles by applying new methodologies, leveraging automated baselining tools, and driving their Scope 3 upstream decarbonization in cross-functional programs that have top management support. In this article, we explore the way semiconductor players can decarbonize their Scope 3 upstream emissions by facilitating cooperative efforts with suppliers, improving waste management, redesigning or enhancing product specifications, and optimizing use of materials.",
            "Our analysis suggests that upstream emissions for a typical fab have three main sources (Exhibit 1):",
            "Of course, every fab may differ from the norm in some respects. For instance, some companies may already rely on chemical suppliers that prioritize renewable energy. But one factor common to many fabs is a lack of clarity about Scope 3 upstream emissions, including the amount associated with specific materials, services, or suppliers. For example, nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), which is commonly used in semiconductor fabrication, rates very high for global warming potential. Fugitive emissionsâthose that escape unintentionallyârelated to the production of NF3 may be higher than the emissions associated with the actual NF3 production process, but these are very difficult to quantify.",
            "Many semiconductor companies may also use misleading assumptions to calculate their Scope 3 upstream emissions. Consider aluminum. While most industries can use 99 percent pure aluminum with no complications, semiconductor companies often require 99.9 percent purityâand that slight improvement requires far more energy, partly because of repetitive melting and cooling as well as the electrochemical purification required, which increases the emissions. The same pattern holds true for many other materials.\n",
            "While fabs may deal with hundreds of suppliers during procurement, our analysis revealed that about six to ten suppliers will account for half of emissions for chemicals, wafers, and gases (Exhibit 2). For maintenance, spare parts, and capital expenditures for equipment upgrades, about three to five suppliers will account for over half of emissions. These patterns mean that semiconductor companies can address the majority of Scope 3 upstream emissions by focusing on a relatively small group of suppliers.",
            "The first step in decarbonizing Scope 3 upstream emissions involves establishing a detailed and reliable baseline. This can be done by examining procurement data for Tier 1 suppliers, including the exact quantities of materials purchased. While fabs will ideally base their analysis on volume data whenever possible, this information may be unavailable or irrelevant for some categories, such as services. In such cases, they must examine spending levels instead. When estimating emissions associated with different materials and services, our approach calls for fabs to factor in the high-energy requirements needed to create semiconductor-grade quality materials (for more information, see sidebar âOur methodology for estimating Scope 3 upstream emissionsâ).",
            "Once semiconductor companies have established emissions baselines for Tier 1 suppliers, they must identify the right set of decarbonization levers to reduce their emissions, focusing on the suppliers and materials that contribute most emissions. The full range of levers spans four areas and requires the involvement of different stakeholders in the organization (Exhibit 3). Semiconductor companies should consider all of these levers to develop the most effective and efficient approach to decarbonization.",
            "Some gains may come from requiring suppliers to use renewable materials or from identifying ways to reduce waste within fabs, thereby decreasing the volume of materials ordered. Other levers involve optimizing the materials used (for instance, using metals with a lower emission footprint or changing product specifications to reduce the need for high-emissions materials). Fabs should consider the cost and decarbonization potential of all levers, but their ability to implement them will differ. The internal stakeholders or functions involved will also vary.",
            "Top leadership commitment and involvement is essential to drive decarbonization across the different functions, including operations, technology, development, and procurement.",
            "When helping suppliers decarbonize, fabs may want to focus on the top three materials categoriesâchemicals, wafers, and gasâbecause of their outsize impact on Scope 3 upstream emissions.",
            "In many cases, fabs may be able to reduce emissions by switching from their current Tier 1 suppliers to those with lower carbon footprints. But if they want to preserve their existing relationships or have no alternatives, fabs can cooperate with their current suppliers to accelerate decarbonization programs. For instance, they might jointly agree on emissions reduction targets, identify abatement levers, and define execution road maps.",
            "For many purchased materials, including wafers, hydrogen peroxide, nitrogen fluoride, and aluminum, energy from conventional sources will account for more than half of emissions during production. Fabs might be able to reduce this percentage by offering financial incentives or other benefits to encourage suppliers to increase their use of renewable energy. The ability to apply this lever will vary, however, since suppliers may be located in countries that offer limited access to renewable energy. For some chemicals and process gases, fabs might also collaborate with suppliers that can offer innovative production processes or synthetic routes that lower overall emissions.",
            "Many emissions arise from Tier 2 suppliers that do not interact directly with fabs, or from suppliers that are even further upstream. These suppliers also contribute to a fabâs Scope 3 upstream emissions, so they need to be part of any decarbonization efforts. Tier 1 suppliers might be best positioned to encourage Tier 2 suppliers to reduce emissions, since their relationship as end customers may give them more leverage. While it may seem difficult for suppliers to cooperate along the value chain, examples of past collaborations exist. For instance, semiconductor companies and Tier 1 suppliers of tools and chemicals worked closely together to reduce the usage of perfluorocarbons when regulators began discouraging their use.",
            "about 15 percent of Scope 3 upstream emissions at fabs, with 90 percent of the total resulting from the electricity required for ore to become polysilicon (a Tier 2 product), which is then transformed to monosilicon (Tier 1). To reduce emissions, semiconductor companies could investigate entirely new strategies, such as crafting monosilicon bids that favor Tier 1 suppliers that use a high percentage of green energy and engage in process heat recycling (exhibit). But they also need to look further upstreamâand that is where they may encounter more difficulties. Chinese companies currently produce 80 to 90 percent of the worldâs polysilicon, and Chinaâs share of renewable energy is expected to remain under 50 percent through 2030, according to the ",
            ". Tier 1 suppliers might be in the best position to encourage the Tier 2 polysilicon companies to decarbonize, especially if they are critical end customers, since they will have more leverage and greater insights about polysilicon volumes. As with Tier 1 suppliers, use of green energy and process heat recycling will be important for Tier 2s, as will the greater use of biomass in the conversion of ore to polysilicon. If all efforts at decarbonization still fall short of net zero at Tier 1 companies and other upstream vendors, they might consider purchasing carbon credits.",
            "Although semiconductor companies deal with too many suppliers to develop an individual decarbonization plan for each one, they can still drive improvement throughout the entire vendor base by implementing new procurement strategies, such as policies that give preference to suppliers that disclose their emissions or that have lower emissions than their competitors (see sidebar âDecarbonizing wafer productionâ for examples of concrete steps that fabs can take).",
            "Over the short to medium term, fabs can also reduce Scope 3 upstream emissions by taking steps to decrease waste within their facilities, but they must first balance trade-offs and identify potential risks. Consider wafer cleaning. A single wafer runs through more than 100 different chemical baths while being processed. Fabs might be able to increase the number of wafers processed in the same chemical bath to reduce waste, but cross-functional teams would first need to determine when reuse might decrease yield to an unacceptable level. Fabs might also investigate whether they can extend the life of machine parts by increasing predictive maintenance, or determine if they can reduce use of spare parts by specifying that they should only be replaced once specific triggers, such as particle counts, are exceeded.",
            "Recyclingâan area where few fabs undertake extensive effortsâcould also decrease waste if leaders expand their current programs. For instance, they could investigate the possibility of introducing recycling programs for materials, such as ultra-high-purity aluminum, that have not been previously reused. Whenever recyclates are investigated, fabs must determine how they can remove impurities to meet the semiconductor industryâs high standards. Moving recycling on-site could also decrease waste.",
            "In some cases, fabs may be able to use lower-emissions materials, chemicals, or gases during production. First, however, companies must set up R&D, quality, and engineering teams to identify better manufacturing methods, evaluate alternatives, and review product specifications. With any change in production or composition, the teams must evaluate trade-offs, such as a potential decrease in product performance, and determine what is acceptable.",
            "To facilitate progress, semiconductor leaders may cooperate with industry organizations to develop green alternatives to emissions-heavy materials, chemicals, and gases, such as fluorinated chemicals.",
            "Fabs might contemplate changing product specifications to reduce emissionsâfor instance, they could evaluate whether existing purity grades for certain metals are truly essential. Again, many trade-offs come into play. In some cases, loosening requirements may achieve the dual goal of reducing emissions and driving cost improvements. In other instances, however, less stringent requirements might introduce quality issues that lower yield.",
            "Since fabs have not made any extensive efforts to reduce emissions by changing product specifications, their initial focus should involve fairly straightforward solutions, such as the use of lower-grade chemicals during less critical steps of the wafer-cleaning process. Over the longer term, they can consider more complex process changes, such as finding replacements for highly emissive materials, since these may become increasingly important as semiconductor end customers push for zero emissions throughout the supply chain.",
            "Although the supplier landscape is fragmented, with many vendors and products, companies can still develop a viable strategy for reducing Scope 3 upstream emissions. With six to ten suppliers accounting for half of all emissions for chemicals, wafers, and gasesâthe top three materials categoriesâfabs may want to concentrate their initial efforts on this group. When implementing decarbonization levers, the effort must go beyond procurement to encompass product and operational changes. Such broad efforts may actually produce better results, since many semiconductor companies encounter difficulties when attempting to change suppliers. Because decarbonization efforts will be broad in scope, they will require the involvement of top leadership and stakeholders from all relevant groups, including operations, procurement, and R&D. Some semiconductor companies are already launching initiatives to reduce Scope 3 upstream emissions, and they could emerge as early leaders. Now itâs time for others to follow their example.",

            "Our recent experience working with major IDMs and OSATs shows that a concerted back-end manufacturing transformation can produce significant performance benefits over a 12- to 18-month period. The most successful transformations take a holistic approach, covering overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) potential (including digital implementation and automation), in-plant planning, supply chain coordination, total cost of performance, and output quality (yield, scrap, and failures). Effectively implemented, action in these areas can lead to a 20 to 30 percent ",

            "The keys to capturing back-end performance benefits are automation and digital innovation. In practical terms, this would play out across multiple aspects of operations. However, an important first step would be establishing a digital control roomâa âbridge on the shipâ that would facilitate analysis of bottleneck process steps such as grinding, wire bonding/lid attach, testing, or burn-in. The impact of creating a holistic, digitally informed overview can boost OEE by as much as 20 percent. In one use case, test parameter optimization leveraging digital and analytics led to a 13 percent reduction in test time (Exhibit 2).",
            "A common thread running through these experiences is that data is the lifeblood of successful transformation, supporting optimization end to end and ensuring that maintenanceâfor example, of handlers and testersâis timely and effective (Exhibit 3). In one pilot program, a company achieved a 40 percent reduction in downtime by introducing predictive maintenance processes. Another data-driven unlock is RTD (real-time dispatching), which can be linked to broader supply chain coordination.

            "A common challenge is that companies do not have the infrastructure to detect or remedy inefficiencies in shop-floor operations. Thus the transformation would ideally embed advanced capabilities into the operating system. Enhancements would include visual management techniques, including color coding lots or lot placements in specific labeled locations. They would also include work-in-progress flow routines and standard operating procedures (SOP) to monitor changeovers and operator performance. An often overlooked factor is machine layout, which should be optimized to reduce waiting times and improve material flow.",

            "At senior levels, a common challenge is a weak KPI structure and manual or semi-automated data gathering from unconnected systems. This leads to a lack of transparency and often delayed action. In addition, high-level goals are not translated into shop-floor and shift targets, reflecting a disconnect between senior management and daily operations. Commonly, shop-floor operators are not clear on expectations, leading to limited engagement and low retention rates.",
            "Disconnect can be mitigated through clear KPIs and the use of dashboards for oversight and monitoring. These should be indexed to daily shop-floor operations (for instance, dies produced or tested per shift and area or overall yield per shift). Regular meetings at the senior level should be held to monitor processes and resolve bottlenecks. Where targets are missed, senior management should support issue resolution, participate in Gemba walks (a lean approach where managers physically visit the shop floor), and work to remove potential roadblocks. Conversely, where targets are met or exceeded, achievements should be recognized and rewarded, then adjusted to capture improvements.",
            "Effective organizational change is predicated on culture and mindset. Simple measures such as regular feedback sessions, presentation of successes to senior managers, and tailored learning modules (for example, on automation, manufacturing principles, and quality) can stoke enthusiasm and ensure decision making is aligned.",
            "Typically, a change in leadership style is required. Leaders will apply the leader âstandard work,â defining what, when, and how leaders should take action. This may mean, for example, being on the shop floor for Gemba walks and process confirmations, supporting root cause problem solving, and offering regular feedback and coaching. Shift managers, meanwhile, should work to boost autonomy at shop-floor level and lead performance dialogues. Team-building initiatives can help forge a sense of collaboration and learning. At the same time, a tailored capability-building program around manufacturing excellence and industrial automation will help embed and sustain the transformation.",
            "Finally, companies should not be embarrassed to celebrate their successes. It makes sense to articulate and communicate the transformation change story, address cultural resistance head-on, and showcase how personal- and operational-performance improvements go hand in hand.",

The most successful are built on three pillarsâoperating systems, management systems, and mindsets and behaviors. Our experience shows that a combination of analytical and automation tools, enhanced oversight, and cultural change can produce results in just one or two months, while capacity gains accrue over one to two years.

            " They argued that the inherent inefficiencies of general-purpose compute architectures (for example, CPUs) will start to yield to (or be complemented by) the compute power and cost efficiency of architectures optimized for specific computational tasks, also called domain-specific architectures (DSAs) (exhibit).",
            "At the same time, as compute and digitization are proliferating into many application domains, such as cloud (AI and high-performance computing), networking, edge, the Internet of Things (IoT), and autonomous driving, highly domain-specific computational workloads are expanding the opportunities for DSAs to offer meaningful performance advantages. Large language models, a core engine for generative AI, through applications such as ChatGPT provide further specialization within AI workloads at very high volume and may lead to further hardware specialization.",
            "The commercial potential of DSAsâhardware and software developed for a specific application domainâis sizable. Already, graphics processing units (GPUs) and tensor processing units (TPUs) have gained significant market share in data centers, where they outperform CPUs for workloads that benefit from a high degree of parallelization, such as AI workloads (learning and inferencing). The performance improvements can be dramatic, with workload-specific accelerations of 15 to 50 times being common. In automotive, customized solutions from leading providers deliver the low-latency, high-performance inference needed to safely support increasing levels of autonomous driving.",

Therefore, it is not a surprise that we have seen a marked increase in venture capital inflows into domain-specific design start-ups, with $18 billion of funding supporting roughly 150 start-ups cumulatively in the past ten years, a stark difference with the decade prior, when hardware investments were shunned in favor of software.",

The more expensive the chip (driven by die size, complexity, and process technology node), the larger the scale required from the application domain to justify a DSA. Fueling the disruptive potential of DSAs are the following five important enablers that are coming together to narrow the economic gap between general-purpose and domain-specific designs:",
            "Foundriesâcompanies that focus on semiconductor manufacturing servicesâhave taken increasing share of global semiconductor manufacturing because they can aggregate demand and achieve the efficiencies of scale needed to offset the escalating cost of producing modern semiconductors. (The cost of a leading-edge semiconductor fabrication plant, or âfab,â is more than $10 billion.) Not only have foundries steadily gained manufacturing market share across technology nodes, but they also offer access to the most advanced technology nodes, an edge held until recently by integrated device manufacturers. As a result, any start-up with a clever idea for an outperforming DSA design can rapidly access the most advanced manufacturing to have it built without having to invest a single dollar in manufacturing capacity.",
            "Would-be providers of superior DSAs, specifically those targeting enterprise, AI, or high-performance computing (HPC) workloads, do not necessarily need to develop their own go-to-market infrastructure. They can rely on a mature ecosystem of cloud service providers (CSPs) that offer compute as a service. If they can demonstrate to CSPs and their customer base that their DSA offers superior compute performance (per dollar and per watt) for specific workloads, their hardware solutions can be integrated into the CSP data center infrastructure and be offered as a hardware instance to end customers of the compute cycles.",
            "Even though DSAs are, by definition, designed for domain-specific workloads, this does not mean DSA designers have to start from scratch when designing the circuitry. Licensable instruction set architectures (ISAs), such as Arm and x86, and open-source ISAs such as RISC-V democratize chip design and provide a rich set of building blocks and ready-to-go design components. They also permit access to the respective ecosystems of compilers and application-level software solutions. Choosing between these different ecosystems as a foundation will be a trade-off between software stack maturity, cost, and domain-specific hardware performance.",
            "Increasingly, leading-edge compute devices are no longer made up of a single chip. As high-performance chips have grown bigger and process technology has become more expensive and more difficult to deliver at high process yields, leading players have moved to a disaggregation strategy, building chiplets rather than a single large, monolithic die. These chiplets, potentially optimized on their own process technology and for their own functions, are subsequently integrated in an advanced package. Where chip packages used to contain only one chip, advanced packaging allows for the heterogeneous integration of tens of chips in a single package, arranged in 2-D and even in 3-D. This technology trend is favorable for firms focusing on DSA chiplets, since these chiplets can now be integrated in advanced packages, allowing for connectivity with other compute, communication, memory, and analog components with extremely high bandwidth and low latency.",

            " chair and CEO of Coherent, formerly II-VI, has spent a lifetime building businesses by harnessing breakthrough technologies. At Coherent, he has championed a strategy focused on acquisitions to achieve scale and deliver innovations in the industrial, communications, electronics, and instrumentation markets. McKinseyâs AndrÃ© Andonian and Abhijit Mahindroo sat down with him to discuss the lessons he has learned and his plans for the future. An edited version of the conversation follows.",
            " Chuck, you spent almost equal amounts of time at AT&T Bell Laboratories and then II-VI, now Coherent. What are the biggest lessons youâve learned?",
            " I started at Bell in advanced materials and the semiconductor device laboratory, with a great interest in making devices that would allow people to get closer to each other. It was the largest industrial research lab then, with more than 25,000 people and 15,000 PhDs. There was expertise in basically every important technology. I learned a lot about culture, organization, people, technology, and business at such a large company. So when I joined II-VI, which was a totally different scale, I was interested in how innovation happened in a small one.",
            "Innovation in a large company allows lots of technology options to be advanced. And integrating those fundamental technologies enabled it to bring breakthrough solutions to market and scale them quickly.",
            "At Coherent, over the past 20 years, we have acquired more than 20 companies. We have learned a lot about integrating technologies and organizing management and talent. We also learned how to incorporate innovation, curiosity, and imagination into a product portfolio based on advanced materials.",
            " II-VI began as a specialized materials company and now, as Coherent, has many technology platforms in multiple verticals and end markets. How did this happen?",
            " It happened through innovation, imagination, and an aspiration to enable the world to be safer, healthier, closer, and more efficientâwhich, in fact, is our mission. When I joined, the companyâs core activity was making CO2 laser optics and materials for components for cutting and welding steel. But we set out to become a global company through acquisition and investment. More than 20 acquisitions later, we are a $5 billion company.",
            " Coherent is a unique company dealing with photons and electrons. Why is this important?",
            " The foundation of all our businesses lies in advanced materials. Electrons and photons are fundamental particles of the universe. And for a materials company that delivers, among other things, lasers and electronics, they are essential to everything we do. At the end of the day, the most basic physical processes we use and harness involve generating and collecting photons. These come about by way of very specialized physical processes within the atom. Likewise, electrons play an important role in imparting physical properties to our semiconductor materials and systems, including the laser, but also semiconductor-powered electronics.",
            " Coherent plays in the value chain from components and modules to subsystems and potentially even to systems. At the same time, its businesses serve both internal and external customers. What drives this strategy?",
            " It is a great question because people often ask about our vertically integrated strategy. When we think about investments, we ask ourselves some basic questions: One, what is our value proposition? Two, what core competencies do we have or need to fulfill that value proposition? And three, what are our sources of sustainable competitive advantage? Building a vertically integrated business on a materials foundation has allowed us to expand the range and complexity of our offeringsâand to anticipate customer requirements and incorporate them into our products.",
            "When we think about investments, we ask ourselves some basic questions: One, what is our value proposition? Two, what core competencies do we have or need to fulfill that value proposition? And three, what are our sources of sustainable competitive advantage?",
            "In moving from materials to components, to subsystems, and now with Coherent, these four levels of integration mean we can manage the value chain to deliver to our customers exactly what they need.",
            "A vertically integrated model of serving businesses allows us to accelerate time to market and make efficient use of the assets. As a manufacturing company, our investments in R&D and manufacturing must make a decent return. So it is like a symphony inside the company as we grow. Conducting and synchronizing that symphony is partly how we compete and why it is difficult to keep up with us.",
            " Building on this symphony idea, you are continuously expanding the orchestra and the types of music that Coherent can produce. How do you develop this strategy? And how do you capture the full potential of these transactions?",
            " The process for the strategy involves a lot of people. It starts with a management decision to invest in markets that will sustain the companyâs growth, allow us to define a leadership position, and continue to generate long-term stakeholder value. It involves all our people, our investors, the communities that we operate in, and our aspiration to change the world.",
            "Our board has been engaged in a review process since the company was founded more than 50 years ago. Their process of questioning, challenging, and refining has served the company extremely well.\nSo, strategy starts with deciding what to do and what not to do. And those have been important moments for us, including when we had to step back and ask ourselves, âWhat aspects of our strategy are not working?â",
            " Coherent operates in many different countries. How do you ensure there is alignment between leaders and employees? And how do you create such a strong culture?",
            " We operate today in 18 countries and 78 locations. But I think the transparency of our purpose, mission, and values has generated a deep foundation of trust. That trust has allowed us to move faster than our competitors in deciding and executing.",
            "We operate today in 18 countries and 78 locations. But I think the transparency of our purpose, mission, and values has generated a deep foundation of trust. That trust has allowed us to move faster than our competitors in deciding and executing.",
            " Over the past two years, tremendous uncertainty and geopolitical risk have buffeted the global economy. How can multinational corporations think about navigating such uncertainty?",
            " Our willingness to focus on a bold path forward has always challenged us to assess risk and put a risk management framework in place. I think our diversification, global footprint, and ability to communicate have created a strong foundation of trust that has allowed us to operate in the face of the pandemic and other challenges. Also, we are helped by having a diversified global leadership team of people who have been willing to stay with us.",
            " One of the biggest challenges of our times is sustainability. How does Coherent contribute to addressing this?",
            " Our vision is a world transformed through innovative materials vital to the sustainability of future generations. We are a leading supplier of communications, computing, and consumer electronics, and these technologies have brought the world together, held it together, and allowed it to become more efficient. In addition, we have set our organization up to deliver long-term sustainable value, including in the electrification of transportation, where we are a leading innovator in silicon carbide power electronics.",
            " How do you retain personal and institutional creativity and that of the institution over such a long period?",
            " I have to do more and more through other people. I focus on inspiring, sparking, challenging, establishing, and encouraging people to move quickly, avoid hidden biases, and fail early and often. My passion for watching people learn and grow has only deepened as the company has expanded.",
            " Talent is a major differentiator for long-term success. What approach do you take to attracting, retaining, and developing the best talent for Coherent?",
            " At AT&T Bell Laboratories, I learned that high-tech people in a high-tech company, as well as enabling functions, have two things in common: they want exciting and challenging jobs and a manager, a leader, or a group of people around them who know more than they do and can help them. Their autonomy gives them a sense of purpose and allows them to contribute to the world and realize their potential with the necessary assets and resources. And that becomes a magnet for people who want to join us because our platform is an exciting place to learn and grow.",
            "Also, there is a lot that we know we do not know. But one thing I discovered is that humility should ground the companyâs culture.",
            " What advice would you give a young professional just setting out in this field?",
            " When I started, I thought about it as a lifetime of learning. It is really important to be around people who are smart, hardworking, nice, patient, and who help us overcome our own gaps and shortcomings.",
            "I think the most important behaviors are the willingness to continue to ask questions, read the literature, study what people have already considered, and embrace being together, collaborating, and learning from each other.",
            " What has kept you excited during your tenure at II-VI and Coherent?",
            " When we recently completed a large acquisition, we changed up the values of the acquired company. I realized how important values are and that we are a little different. Our values are integrity, collaboration, accountability, respect, and enthusiasm. And taken together, in that order, they have allowed our employees to declare âI careâ as the primary reason for them to come to the company, stay with us, and help change the world.",

An enabler of these capabilities is electric/electronic (E/E) and software architecture, which is set to play a vital role in shaping the automotive and semiconductor value chain.",

            ", representing 6 percent growth (CAGR) from 2019 to 2030. Meanwhile, higher numbers of more complex features put heavy demands on systems, while software issues can cause launch delays or recalls. With 150 or more electronic control units (ECUs) in some premium vehicles, significant development, integration, and validation are required. In that context, E/E architecture is a critical variable that requires nuanced judgements over budgets and configuration.",
            "Automotive E/E architectures have evolved from early generations based on decentralized models and single ECUs, to ever-increasing numbers of ECUs and closer integration. In the past few years, domain centralized architectures have emerged, through which a few domain computers replace several ECUs, enabling more complex cross-domain functions.",
            "The most recent (",
            ") architecture introduces zonal controllers and central compute units (Exhibit 1). These have the potential to manage rising numbers of control units, as well as simplify software stacks and feature deployment. However, they also create challenges for car makers, including relating to latency and optimal controller topology, where there are significant design differences across the industry. In this article, we drill down into these competing dynamics and consider strategies for value chain participants as the market evolves.",
            "The single biggest design benefit of fifth-generation architectures is that they offer OEMs the ability to simplify the control unit landscape. Still, as OEMs transition, they need to gauge the potential benefits of different technical approaches, which can be broadly categorized under the following four banners:",
            "Based on factors including announced E/E architecture launches, expert estimates, typical platform production times, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) adoption, and total cost of ownership benefits for different vehicles classes, we expect the global share of vehicles with zonal architecture to reach around 18 percent in 2030, while domain-based architectures (including light architectures with only one domain compute unit (DCU) and full architectures, in which all domains have a DCU) will account for 48 percent and distributed architecture for 34 percent (Exhibit 2). The latter is due to the fact that we will still see vehicles produced on older architectures as well.",
            "The analysis carried out for this paper suggests the automotive compute unit market (distributed ECUs, DCUs, zonal compute units [ZCUs], and central compute units [CCUs]) will grow at a rate of around 6 percent annually between 2023 and 2030 (Exhibit 3). Because of consolidation in functionality, the ECU market will contract slightly (â1 percent annually) while the market for domain compute units (DCU), ZCU, and CCU will grow at around 30 to 40 percent per year. The significant market value for CCUs is the result of relatively high prices ($1,000 to $4,000 depending on the Society of Automotive Engineersâ [SAE] level for the ADAS/AD part). By contrast, average selling prices (ASPs) for zone controllers are expected to price in the $50 to $70 range.",
            "When it comes to zonal controller design, value chain participants must consider a range of use case and application scenarios, identifying the most appropriate to match their propositions. There are four emerging archetypes, each of which offers a distinct set of benefits at different price points:",
            "As they consider how best to configure E/E architecture, value chain participants, including chip makers, tier-1 players, and OEMs need to make judgements across several dimensions. First, they must understand what domains will be most impacted, and what will change and not change in the move to zonal or central controllers. From a strategic perspective, decision makers must be clear on where they are best equipped to play. This will lay the groundwork for a plan on how to most productively engage.",
            "The various vehicle domains have different requirements. The body, the powertrain, and the chassis are most suitable for zonal controllers, which consolidate functionality in areas that typically rely on a larger set of distributed ECUs, sensors, and actuators at the mechanical rim of a vehicle (Exhibit 4).",
            "ADAS/AD and infotainment domains, by contrast, require significantly more compute power than zonal controllers can provide. Thus, these are likely to be implemented through a central or dedicated domain compute unit. Connectivity also demands a separate unit, due mainly to cybersecurity requirements and its role in processing OTA updates.",
            "As a result of the different requirements of each domain, zonal and central compute E/E architectures will need to be built on a range of software stacks (for example, AUTOSAR Classic, AUTOSAR Adaptive, or a tailored RTOS). Service-oriented architecture will play a key role, especially for zone, domain, and central compute units, and will, for instance, support flexibility in software function deployment. As a result, the importance of automotive middleware solutions and players will rise, despite the fact that they are non-differentiating for customers.",
            "As zonal and central compute units consolidate functionality across several domains, the transition to next-generation E/E architectures will likely accelerate the dissolution of functional siloes and boost research into end-to-end customer functionality. Tier-1 players and OEMs will need to collaborate more deeply, starting with common software architecture and middleware solutions, but also through joint development teams in agile settings to ensure frequent releases. This will be enabled by more stringent hardware and software separation and leveraging best practice in systems engineering. With cross-domain applications running on zonal controllers, OEMs will need to invest even more in software integration and validation.",
            "Across the industry, we expect to see the formation of new ecosystems, alliances, and standards, especially for non-differentiating elements of the automotive hardware and software stack.",
            "Meanwhile, semiconductor players will have their own priorities. Intellectual property (IP)/electronic design automation (EDA) and fabless operators may increasingly focus on scalable compute platforms that support different performance requirements. They may also think about new collaboration models to ensure easier integration of functional blocksâespecially when chiplets become more common in the automotive segment toward the end of the decade. Chiplets separate the SoC into composite parts, creating the potential to build more powerful chips from smaller, standardized building blocks. This ensures higher yields and combat issues such as the reticle limit in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography.",
            "For IDMs or fabless players and wafer foundries, capacity reservations will become more common. These will increase transparency on planning horizons and strengthen supply chain resilience. We expect foundries to incrementally become more active in automotive, reflecting the sectorâs predicted 11 percent annual demand growth (CAGR) up to 2030. Meanwhile, OEMs will engage more actively with electronics manufacturing services (EMS) players and original design manufacturers (ODMs) as they diversify their supplier networks.",
            "As OEMs turn increasingly to in-sourcing for E/E architecture, tier-1s will need to compete hard in architecture design and implementation. They can differentiate by building reference architectures and showcasing their capabilities. OEMs could also focus on customization of specific chips and accumulating know-how to enable tailoring, for example in the ADAS/AD domain. For IDMs this may create an opportunity for co-innovation and marketing of cutting-edge technologies. One impact will likely be more directed-buy arrangements, disrupting traditional value chain dynamics.",
            "Across the board, software skill sets will be critical enablers. Amid intense competition, companies that take a strategic approach to hiring and retention will likely get ahead of their peers.",
            "To meet rising customer demand for more digital automotive experiences, the automotive value chain must embrace vital enablers of transition. Zonal and centralized E/E architectures will play a central role, allowing for the simplification of control units, continuous updates, and through-the-lifecycle monetization. As part of this process, OEMs in particular need to balance business benefits against potential costs. For example, they must decide how much compute power is required now and in future, and strike a balance on trade-offs such as wake-up time and power management. As they ponder these variables, the most successful will prioritize a strategic approach, creating an optimal model for transition over time.",

        "paragraphs": [
            " complex equipmentâsuch as aerospace and defense (A&D) companies or heavy-equipment OEMsâface a recurring challenge. Their products have extremely long life cycles of 30 years or more, during which they need to provide legacy-parts support. But the internal components for those systems, including semiconductors, electronic boards, and mechanical parts, have much shorter life cycles, in some cases less than five years. Because of this disparityâwhat we call the âtwo speedâ challengeâcomponents can become harder to source over time and even grow obsolete as suppliers struggle to source the raw materials or stop manufacturing them altogether.",
            "This article is a collaborative effort by Hugo Del Campo, Giulietta Poltronieri, Alessandro Simoncini, Alfredo Vaghi, and ",
            ", representing views from McKinseyâs Aerospace & Defense Practice.",
            "As a result, OEMs must design replacements for those obsolete components and face nonrecurring engineering costs as a result. We estimate that aggregate obsolescence-related nonrecurring costs",
            " for the military aircraft segment alone are in the range of $50 billion to $70 billion. This estimate is based on an in-depth model that accounts for aircraft category, generation, and projected remaining in-service years, thus providing an estimate of the number of obsolescence cycles and related costs. The problem of nonrecurring engineering costs is growing worse as technology cycles accelerate and supply chains become more interconnected.",
            "However, a proactive and systematic approach can help OEMs address obsolescence-related nonrecurring costs in their entirety. Specifically, companies can follow three essential steps to reduce the nonrecurring engineering costs for obsolete components. They can also become more proactive about addressing component issues ",
            " components become obsolete. Together, these actions can reduce overall costs of obsolescence management by up to 35 percent in just a few months.",
            "The two-speed challenge is growing, but there is a clear opportunity for companies to take decisive measures to address it, leading to improved financial performance and a better customer experience.",
            "For industrial OEMs (such as A&D companies), heavy-equipment manufacturers, and other producers of highly advanced, complex equipment, the two-speed challenge between life cycles for overall systems and for internal components can have implications across multiple functions:",
            "Moreover, the challenge is getting worse. Technology cycles are accelerating, meaning that internal components have a correspondingly shorter life cycle. In addition, the pandemic has highlighted supply chain constraints. In the short term, the world is experiencing a scarcity of semiconductor components and increased raw-material costs. Once the pandemic ends, however, complex and interconnected supply chains will still remain, and companies will need the means to ensure a reliable supply of components for the long term.",
            "The ongoing war for talent adds another dimension to the challenge. Many industriesâparticularly A&Dâface increasingly scarce engineering resources. Proactively addressing obsolescence challenges helps companies ensure that their best people can focus on the value-adding work of designing innovative new products and services, rather than pulling them away to respond to component shortages.",
            "Since the problem is large and growing, companies need a systematic, structured approach to address obsolete components. McKinseyâs experience working with industrial companies points to three steps.",
            " The first step is to identify any potential alternate suppliers for a given component that faces obsolescence. This is the most attractive solution, as it avoids virtually all new engineering costs. A comprehensive scan of the market, with full engagement from the OEM, distributors, and brokers, can help companies track down component sources, identify those that do not require a redesign, and buy up all remaining units at a reasonable cost (in accordance with existing procurement rules).",
            "Once components have been identified, each supplier must still undergo a screening process to verify its capabilities and qualifications. The screening includes validating process quality, anticounterfeit measures, parts traceability, and a supplierâs ability to export into key manufacturing regions such as the European Union and the United States. Once a supplier has been selected, OEMs should validate stock availability for each supplier and component.",
            " The second step is to find a similar component in the marketâone that is close in fit, form, and function (FFF) to the component becoming obsoleteâand then modify it as needed. This step allows companies to minimize nonrecurring engineering costs and avoid a full redesign. For each component to be modified, OEMs need to determine the amount of redesign work required and then create a business case to understand the true financial impact of this step. Success requires looking at a broader universe of components and developing a detailed understanding of how they differ from the unit under consideration. To scan the market efficiently, companies can identify experts who can assess the availability of FFF components for specific technical areas and commodities (exhibit). (Notably, even after redesign, new parts will still need to be validated and qualified, though the costs will be lower than for a full redesign.)",
            " The third option, in the event that no exact or FFF replacements are available, is to redesign a new component while minimizing costs and reducing any disruption to existing system design. Specific measuresâsuch as conducting cross-functional, design-to-value workshops for the components under consideration and involving design experts and cost engineers early in the processâcan reduce the processâs time, cost, and complexity.",
            "The three steps outlined above are an effective and practical way to address obsolescence issues once they have emerged, but OEMs can also proactively identifyâand mitigateâpotential obsolescence issues before they arise. The following measures should be priorities.",
            " First, companies can develop a new modus operandi that continually scans for potential obsolescence issues. A dedicated, cross-functional team should be assembledâwith representation from the procurement, R&D, manufacturing, and quality functionsâand tasked with developing a set of lead indicators to assess components, identify near-term issues, and develop countermeasures. For example, companies can allocate a budget specifically for resolving obsolescence issues and launch processes to make strategic last-time buys of all potential components at risk of obsolescence.",
            " Because complex systems can have thousands of subcomponents, companies would benefit from having the means to track highly granular obsolescence information on a system-wide or enterprise-wide level. Advanced tools are available that can consolidate internal information from OEMs with external market-based data, generating a single, integrated view of components that are obsolete, alternative suppliers, potential FFF options, and the cost implications of various mitigation measures. The result is a significant increase in transparency, enabling companies to understand all future obsolescence issues and address them efficiently.",
            " Designating âobsolescence championsâ in the organization can ensure that OEMs formally allocate responsibility for this issue to a single individual (or team) who can directly engage with suppliers to anticipate supply chain disruptions. Companies can also take concerted steps to improve capabilities through training and other initiatives. More broadly, linking incentives to supply chain performance encourages teams to adopt the right behaviors.",
            " Last, OEMs of advanced industrial products should factor component obsolescence into the design of new offerings by identifying and addressing root causes in cooperation with engineering units, suppliers, and other stakeholders. This will require developing joint technology road maps, adopting standardized interfaces, applying modular designs, using common designs among different products (where possible), and minimizing the number of highly specialized components.",
            "Obsolescence management is increasingly important for OEMs of low-volume, high-complexity products. Organizations that continue to ignore this challenge will likely face ongoing issues in operations, marketing and sales, finance, and aftermarket services, potentially leading to higher costs, fewer commercial opportunities, and reduced customer satisfaction. Conversely, those that take a proactive, systematic approachâto address currently obsolete components and those that could soon become soâcan generate corresponding gains in performance.",

Ongoing excitement about the potential of AI, driven by advances in generative AI, is pushing the industry to rethink the scope of its transformation plans. However, many telco leaders are struggling to manage the talent implications of these shifts, including determining what talent they need and how to beat out the competition to get it.",
            "The industry has certainly not lacked for engineering PhDs or other markers of technical acumen over the years. But the tech talent market, and telcosâ position within it, have changed dramatically since the generation that is now on the brink of retirement embarked on their careers.",

        "title": "From product-led growth to product-led sales: Beyond the PLG hype",
        "description": "It’s touted as a panacea for tech companies, but a product-led growth strategy often has to be complemented by elements of a more traditional enterprise model to succeed.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " software-as-a-service (SaaS) innovators, including Atlassian and Slack, pioneered the product-led growth (PLG) model, the strategy has often been viewed as the âholy grailâ for achieving efficient growth and above-average returns. Many tech companies, from other SaaS natives to established enterprise software providers to consumer product brands, have embraced this model. By giving customers control from the get-go, with the product at the center of customer acquisition, retention, and expansion, the theory goes, companies can scale their businesses with lower sales costs, greater product virality, and higher net retention.",
            "However, succeeding with PLG is far from a simple proposition. Our research suggests that only a few companies that use it actually achieve outsize performance, and they do so by increasingly developing a hybrid motion known as product-led sales (PLS). This innovative approach combines elements of PLG with the more traditional enterprise model of sales-led growth (SLG), in which a salesperson sells the software in a long sales cycle, typically to a senior executive. Our research further shows that the companies that implement PLS most effectively can enjoy sizeable boosts in both revenue growth and valuation ratios.",
            "As the moniker suggests, being a product-led company means giving the product itself a critical role in acquiring, growing, and retaining customers. While certain characteristics, such as the time to value (TTV) and inherent virality, determine the extent to which companies can shift to a product-led approach, all B2B software companies can adopt some aspects of this model in their go-to-market (GTM) motion by investing in the following elements:",
            "The common perception among software executives and investors is that product-led companies outperform their sales-led peers in revenue growth, operating efficiency, and market valuations. And while this is true in some cases, our recent analysis of 107 publicly listed B2B SaaS providers shows that most companies adopting product-led motions are not enjoying any boost. Although the product-led companies enjoy higher revenue growth rates than their sales-led peers on average, just a select subset of outperformers account for most of that disparity (Exhibit 1).",
            "The stark differences between the few product-led outperformers and the rest of the product-led pack as well as more traditional, sales-led companies exist across a range of important SaaS metrics.",
            "The product-led high-performing subset, for instance, spends ten percentage points more in marketing and sales and R&D expenses combined than high-performing, sales-led companies do. They also generate ten percentage points more in annual recurring revenue growth and are able to achieve valuation ratios that are 50 percent higher. Moreover, our research found that average-performing, product-led businesses spend significantly more on operating expenses than their average-performing, sales-led peers, yet fare only marginally better on key performance metrics (Exhibit 2).",
            "The software sector had, for many years, generally believed that a clear distinction existed between the PLG and SLG target markets. Many industry participants and observers were convinced that the pure PLG approach worked best with small and medium-size businesses (SMBs) or particularly tech-savvy buyers, while SLG was the only way to build a scalable business serving enterprise customers. More recently, however, there has been a debate over which model is more likely to lead to strong, sustainable, and efficient growth.",
            "Our experience and research strongly refute the notion of such a sharp dividing line in the two modelsâ applicability. Product-led motions exist on a broad spectrum, enabling most, if not all, B2B software companies to embrace this approach to one degree or another. The lines between PLG and SLG are already starting to blur; pure-play PLG companies are hiring sales teams to cater to large enterprises, while more traditional, SLG-driven companies are investing in product-led experiences to help their sales teams prove the value of the product and appeal to a new class of SMB customers.",
            "This emerging hybrid approach of PLS combines the best of innovative, bottom-up (PLG) and top-down (SLG) techniques to maximize conversion and value at each stage of the customer journey. PLS recognizes the importance of leveraging the product as a primary driver of demand generation while combining it with traditional sales efforts to support customer acquisition. It converts the lead that a self-serve offering has generated into a sales opportunity and attaches a sales rep to close a large contract for an enterprise-level solution.",
            "In the hybrid model, different product- and sales-led tools and tactics are simultaneously used for different personas. One might target C-level buyers, for instance, with a live demo (a traditional SLG component) to give an overview of the productâs value proposition, but it might make more sense to offer the ultimate end users of the product a trial so they can appreciate the productâs value by actually using it. A product-led companyâs senior executive summed up this approach by noting, âOur success comes by simultaneously going bottom-up with individual developers and top-down with technology executives.â Our research shows that optimizing PLSâwhether from a PLG or SLG starting pointâmakes the difference between the leaders and the laggards in product-led performance.",
            "There are two main reasons for the growing appeal of PLS to traditionally SLG-driven enterprises. First, it offers them an effective way to cost-efficiently expand their presence with SMB customers. Contract values in that market segment are generally lower, but with the fixed costs of sales forces not budging, larger SaaS companies have little choice but to leverage self-serve purchase options and minimize human interaction in the sales process. Equally important, PLS helps these incumbent players respond to the evolving expectations of enterprise customers and their increasing need to see and experience the productâs value before committing to a large contract. As software budgets face potential trimming amid the current economic uncertainties, proving the value of the product is more crucial than ever.",
            "At the same time, more and more PLG companies are realizing that an exclusively self-serve approach is incapable of sustaining a companyâs growth trajectory. To keep up the pace, they have to figure out how to turn smaller subscriptions with a small number of users, which typically solves one teamâs needs, into enterprise contracts that cater to thousands of users and provide an enterprise-wide solution. Fulfilling that ambition requires having a sales team to help potential buyers navigate the complex enterprise sales process. By combining their strong self-serve motion with a top-down sales approach, existing try-before-you-buy users (trial or freemium) become the primary funnel for the new sales team. Itâs unsurprising, then, that most public, once-pure PLG B2B companies have now deployed their own sales teams.",
            "The hybrid approach of PLS also aligns with customer preferences. The average customer is influenced by both product-led buying factors (for example, free trials, transparent pricing) and sales-led factors (for example, interaction with the sales team, expertise) in the same buying decision. In our recent survey of 625 SaaS buyers across five different software categoriesâfrom cybersecurity to infrastructure software, 65 percent of buyers said they strongly prefer both sales- and product-led experiences when buying a solution.",
            "Implementing such an integrated motion requires a more coordinated and cross-functional approach to managing end-to-end customer journeys. In a traditional SLG approach, for example, the sales team owns a significant portion of the end-to-end customer journey. This includes outreach, discovery calls, live demos, and negotiations.",
            "By contrast, a hybrid PLS approach requires different functions to take ownership of different parts of the customer journey. Marketing is responsible for overseeing the top of the funnel to generate demand, and product teams optimize the testing stage to demonstrate the value to potential customers. Once trial or freemium users are activated and convinced of the productâs worth, the sales team can then try to convert these users into paying customers. Moreover, the lines of ownership between functions become blurred as they share responsibility for critical experiences. For instance, marketing and product teams collaborate to nurture customers during the trial experience.",
            "As companies adopt a more product-led motion, itâs important to redesign teams to be more cross-functional and multidisciplinary. Those who worked on different stages across the customer journey should be includedâproduct marketers, digital marketers, PMs, designers, engineers, sales and customer success teamsâas they all share a joint mandate, rituals, and forms of collaboration. These agile growth teams also require the introduction of new roles, such as growth engineers, who identify opportunities to increase product virality, improve conversion rates, reduce churn, and increase customer lifetime value. A vital part of this realignment is creating more robust feedback loops among the different teams and optimizing internal processes for this new motion, for example, lead handoffs.",
            "In this new hybrid PLS approach, the main challenge for product teams is to adopt a mindset focused on usage and a form of monetization that is lacking in a traditional SLG motion. Minimizing friction during a trial or freemium to convert users to paid customers and closely monitoring usage to drive adoption and expansion is critical. For their part, sales teams in an integrated model also have to learnâand be motivatedâto change their traditional ways of working and their definition of preliminary success. Whereas enterprise sales are conditioned to value landing the biggest possible deal at the outset, product-led sales focus more on simply landing. They learn to measure engagement, prove a productâs value, and drive expansion and upselling. To ensure a smooth transition to a hybrid model, companies can provide new sales playbooks and tools, realigned incentives, and training to the teams, emphasizing their updated role in this reimagined customer journey.",
            "As companies work to perfect the integrated model, it is essential to avoid a one-size-fits-all mindset. For example, while 59 percent of enterprise infrastructure buyers we surveyed prioritized the need for a free trial, just 10 percent prioritized a proof of value or pilot. However, when it comes to cybersecurity software, the trend was reversed, with vendor-assisted proof of value or pilot being the top buying factor among respondents. Being flexible and choosing the specific approach based on customer preferences and priorities can help companies reap the most rewards from the hybrid model.",
            "To facilitate such an integrated end-to-end approach, PLS requires the introduction of new tools and models into the tech stack:",
            "While building a comprehensive, integrated GTM motion takes at least a year, quick wins can be achieved on the path to this transformation. Enterprise software companies have found success by building product-led experiences in increments, starting small, experimenting continuously, and expanding rapidlyâmuch like the most effective product-led sales motions. The following steps can help guide that journey.",
            " Teams can launch this transformation by working to understand the various user and buyer personas, mapping them out in a flow chart, identifying friction points within the journey, and defining potential touchpoints. Being clear about hand-offs and routing between functions is essential.",
            " The next step should be deciding on key product-led experiences to build and assessing the current status of the assets that can be improved, such as web pages, product demos, try-before-you-buy models, and any encouragement and guidance tools inside the product. At this point, teams can begin to revamp the journey and assets by testing and iterating, measuring effectiveness, and making incremental improvements. For example, one can start by building out a sandboxed trial in a simple read-only format with preloaded data, and use the learnings to develop a full-feature trial later.",
            "The cross-functional growth team, or growth pod, will need the runway to act quickly and decisively, with full decision-making power and sufficient autonomy. Acting as pioneers, the growth pod will lead a fundamental organizational shift within the company, not just a realignment of the sales team. From a change management standpoint, this means most functions will need to alter the way they operate in one way or another. Designing early and truly open feedback loops among functions will be critical to the success of this transition.",
            "A limited budget tends to lead to slow learning and, ultimately, failure. Shifting to a more product-led motion is a systematic change and cannot be achieved as a side project. The first months are an investment into learning and need to be seen as suchâand funded accordingly. Companies that have had the most success have ring-fenced their budget to drive reach and growth in defined regions and test and learn at speed. Initial funding will be key to ensuring that growth teams can succeed early. In the process, they can prove the value of the new approach and ensure buy-in from different stakeholders across the company, which is especially important given that a new product-led motion requires more cross-functional organization and strategy.",
            "For those who execute well, an integrated hybrid go-to-market motion that combines the best product- and sales-led elements can create differentiated returns. As start-ups continue to go upmarket and traditional incumbents evaluate capturing SMB customers, companies may have to consider the merits of embracing the product-led sales modelâor potentially face the risk of disruption. Todayâs differentiating factors may eventually become table stakes in the battle to win and engage customers and achieve above-average growth in enterprise software and many other sectors.",

Customers increasingly expect experiences powered by software and on par with those offered or enabled by the most successful software and tech players. Building a shopping app, for instance, no longer suffices; the experience needs to be as engaging and seamless as it would be if app delivery were the organizationâs core competency.",
            "Investing wisely in software across the entire value chain, from initial customer interactions to internal corporate functions, can help consumer packaged goods (CPG) and retail companies meet these rising expectations. And that investment can pay off in the long run. With technology increasingly a competitive differentiator, companies that make software a core part of their organization and harness emerging technologiesâsuch as AI (including generative AI), mixed reality, and roboticsâcan lay a strong foundation for sustainable growth.",
            "Many retail and consumer players recognize this reality and have already made decisive software and technology investments. For example, Starbucks developed Deep Brew, a tool to leverage AI for various applications. Lego partnered with Epic Games to create a metaverse for kids to connect, playing between digital and physical worlds seamlessly.

            " Our analysis of more than 120 public consumer and retail companies also reveals that those with a mature technology operating model outperform those that operate more traditionally. Markers of strong DevOps and developer tooling, modern engineering practices, best-in-class product development life cycles, and structural and strategic alignment toward products are directly tied to strong business results: organizations with high maturity across these dimensions boast, on average, 2.2 times greater return to shareholders, as well as 40 to 45 percent higher customer engagement and brand awareness, compared with those that have little or no technology operating culture.",

            "Not only should organizations articulate softwareâs role in their culture but also ensure the culture drives customer-centric innovation and fosters a âsoftware mindset.â",
            "Embedding software into organizational culture requires, first and foremost, that companies outline a clear vision for their software business. That means explaining how the value proposition and strategy will impact customer experience, growth, and talentâand communicating this perspective consistently across internal and external forums. According to ",
            ", managers at high-performing consumer companies are 1.6 times more likely to say their digital agenda is integrated into business units rather than siloed in an IT organization.",
            "The right culture is also essential for driving customer-centric innovation. To build such a culture, companies can work to emulate the operating model of leading technology players that use small, cross-functional teams, or pods, to address specific customer needs or journeys. In this model, pods can include employees from software development, agile coaching, data science, product management, technical program management, and user design/research. The teams are typically empowered to own a customer problem space end to end, set their own objectives and key results, and determine their own product road maps and backlogs. They are actively encouraged to base their decisions on customer data, leveraging technologies such as AI and machine learning to predict customersâ needs and deliver value.",
            "That approach dramatically alters the innovation process. The user design/research and product management functions are so deeply embedded in the pods that they help shape the mission statement and the problemâs definition from the get-go, rather than being used only for fine-tuning after overarching development decisions have been made. From our work with retail and CPG companies, we have seen this type of software-centric culture boost customer satisfaction rates by as much as 40 percentage points. Technology-inspired operating models also help push organizationsâ performance closer to that of software players on other metrics. For instance, in one major North American retail brand, we saw this shift lead to a 60 percent improvement in time to market, from idea inception to software delivery, for such offerings as new app features.",

CPG and retail industry product managers need to deeply understand ever-changing consumer habits and preferences, as much of their job is to optimize the digital touchpoint and make the transitions among multiple channels seamless for customers.",
            "Such consumer insight is just part of the overarching talent that sets successful product leaders apartâthe ability to deliver enhanced customer experiences creatively. Product managers have a vast canvas of modern tools and platforms to help serve customers and consumers in new, innovative ways. This capability is particularly important in the consumer retail environment, where offering product experiences that deliver value as well as establish and exceed high user expectations is a true differentiator.",
            "Companies looking to invest in empowered product managers should consider three actions:",
            "Next-generation technology innovation requires a robust underlying tech architecture; however, most companies struggle with legacy systems and usually have more than 20 percent of tech assets in the âtech debtâ category. Moreover, around 60 percent of CIOs have seen tech debt rise in recent years.",
            " At the same time, not all tech debt is bad: modernizing applications adds value, but only up to a point. Consumer companies should prioritize what, how, and when to migrate to a new solution.",
            " ",
            ". A tech stack where all platforms talk to one another is critical. For example, platforms to automate marketing efforts should be able to pull from customer and product databases to personalize messaging and showcase the most attractive items. Failing to integrate these components into a unified tech stack will hinder the potential for technology-driven business improvement.",
            "While certain companies take the more challenging route of leapfrogging to an entirely new tech stack that merges all existing customer and product data, more consumer-facing organizations are likely to take incremental steps. For instance, new business logic can be built out iteratively as modular microservicesâself-contained units of code that execute specific functions with limited dependenciesâeffectively replace the legacy stack. Prioritizing platform upgrades according to the value at stake is important: drawing on our experience in the consumer space, we estimate that 20 to 50 percent of platforms may drive up to 80 percent of the value.",
            "Companies eager to upgrade their platform architecture can gradually switch to a cloud-based approach.

In this context, it is critical to choose a suitable model, set up cloud and data architecture, use MLOps to reduce risk and continuously improve the model in production, and run âLive Opsâ to monitor model performance and manage risk.",
            ". This approach helps to deliver high-quality, ready-to-use data sets that people across an organization can easily access and apply to various tasks, such as keeping up with changing customer buying patterns and trends. Traditional approaches, such as grassroots (managing data across the organization on a team-by-team basis) and big bang (managing data en masse in a centralized team), are highly complex and inefficient. In contrast, managing data as a product creates sustainable value by increasing reusability, interoperability, and speed of new application implementation. For example, customer and product data managed as two data products can be connected to drive hyperpersonalization; product and store data can be linked for assortment optimization.",
            "Once an organization manages its data this way, it can more effectively unlock value from it. For instance, building innovative, data-centric applications is one promising vehicle for leveraging existing data in more meaningful ways than simply modernizing existing application features. Generative AI and foundation models now open many new opportunities for data-centric applications by automating content generation based on data. These models essentially supersede much more of the value chain than traditional, discriminative AI models that are used to predict labels or classifications. For example, companies can leverage marketing data and generative AI to automatically create and deliver hyperpersonalized messages with virtually no incremental costs.",
            "Given the rapid pace of tech innovation, consumer and retail companies often find it beneficial to tap into the ecosystem of tech-forward start-ups and supplier partnerships. The attraction is mutual because the retail ecosystem, unlike software, offers tangible products and various services along the value chain. More tech-forward companies also want to be part of a retail ecosystem to access consumers, other retailers, and best-in-class technologies for that complex environment. In addition, consumers appreciate the innovation an ecosystem can provide; seven in ten consumers in a ",

            "For retailers, broader software integration with their supply chain also drives innovative customer experiences. One example is digital additive manufacturingâthat is, 3-D printing. It requires deep software integration between brands and manufacturers across multiple points of the product development and manufacturing life cycle. Investing in such integration can unlock faster time to market and product customization at scale. For example, premium shoe insole developer Superfeet uses 3-D printing machines at various retail outlets to scan customersâ feet and rapidly build custom orthotics that can be delivered within a week, reducing lead time and costs.",
            "In an evolving software-driven landscape, many companies are already taking steps to transform their go-to-market (GTM) strategies by using tech to increase the functionality of their core offering and drive higher engagement with customers.

Still, insourcing levels are relatively low; our research indicates the share of outsourced IT talent is 40 to 50 percent in retail and 50 to 60 percent in CPG. Insourcing tends to be more prevalent for critical skills, such as product management and app architecture, and less for commoditized roles, such as product support.",
            "For near-term access to bleeding-edge capabilities outside the organization, companies can employ âacquihiring,â or strategically acquiring digital-native companies to access their technology offerings and talent pools.

For example, DÃ¶hler, the natural-ingredient company, joined the SAP Business Network for Logistics to access services and talent from more than 22,000 partners.",
            "In the longer term, companies can attract new talent and differentiate themselves from tech-native companies by focusing on purpose-driven hiring. Consumer companies can distinguish themselves from tech-native enterprises by focusing on the relatability of their brands and the ability for talent to see the tangible impact of their innovations in the marketplace. For example, Nike promotes itself as a company looking to hire âthe most creative people in the worldâ who want to ârevolutionize the future at the confluence of tech and sport.â",

For example, one food retailer decided on a âfrontrunnerâ approach, identifying three high-impact areas of one select business unit where it wanted to pioneer changes before rolling them out more broadly in the organization. As a result, the company gained valuable insights to refine its blueprint for operating in the new model. In addition, team members could double as champions for the new model once the changes started to scale across the rest of the business unit and, ultimately, other business units.

Other functions can be measured reasonably well, some even with just a single metric; whereas in software development, the link between inputs and outputs is considerably less clear. Software development is also highly collaborative, complex, and creative work and requires different metrics for different levels (such as systems, teams, and individuals). Whatâs more, even if there is genuine commitment to track productivity properly, traditional metrics can require systems and software that are set up to allow more nuanced and comprehensive measurement. For some standard metrics, entire tech stacks and development pipelines need to be reconfigured to enable tracking, and putting in place the necessary instruments and tools to yield meaningful insights can require significant, long-term investment.

Unlike a function such as sales, where a system-level metric of dollars earned or deals closed could be used to measure the work of both teams and individuals, software development is collaborative in a distinctive way that requires different lenses. For instance, while deployment frequency is a perfectly good metric to assess systems or teams, it depends on all team members doing their respective tasks and is, therefore, not a useful way to track individual performance.

            "Another critical dimension to recognize is what the various metrics do and do not tell you. For example, measuring deployment frequency or lead time for changes can give you a clear view of certain outcomes, but not of whether an engineering organization is optimized. And while metrics such as story points completed or interruptions can help determine optimization, they require more investigation to identify improvements that might be beneficial.",

The first is DORA metrics, named for Googleâs DevOps research and assessment team. These are the closest the tech sector has to a standard, and they are great at measuring outcomes. When a DORA metric returns a subpar outcome, it is a signal to investigate what has gone wrong, which can often involve protracted sleuthing. For example, if a metric such as deployment frequency increases or decreases, there can be multiple causes. Determining what they are and how to resolve them is often not straightforward.",
            "The second set of industry-developed measurements is SPACE metrics (satisfaction and well-being, performance, activity, communication and collaboration, and efficiency and flow), which GitHub and Microsoft Research developed to augment DORA metrics. By adopting an individual lens, particularly around developer well-being, SPACE metrics are great at clarifying whether an engineering organization is optimized. For example, an increase in interruptions that developers experience indicates a need for optimization. ",
            "On top of these already powerful metrics, our approach seeks to identify what can be done to improve how products are delivered and what those improvements are worth, without the need for heavy instrumentation. Complementing DORA and SPACE metrics with opportunity-focused metrics can create an end-to-end view of software developer productivity (Exhibit 1). ",
            "These opportunity-focused productivity metrics use a few different lenses to generate a nuanced view of the complex range of activities involved with software product development.",
            " To identify specific areas for improvement, itâs helpful to think of the activities involved in software development as being arranged in two loops (Exhibit 2). An inner loop comprises activities directly related to creating the product: coding, building, and unit testing. An outer loop comprises other tasks developers must do to push their code to production: integration, integration testing, releasing, and deployment. From both a productivity and personal-experience standpoint, maximizing the amount of time developers spend in the inner loop is desirable: building products directly generates value ",
            "is what most developers are excited to do. Outer-loop activities are seen by most developers as necessary but generally unsatisfying chores. Putting time into better tooling and automation for the outer loop allows developers to spend more time on inner-loop activities. ",
            "Top tech companies aim for developers to spend up to 70 percent of their time doing inner-loop activities. For example, one company that had previously completed a successful agile transformation learned that its developers, instead of coding, were spending too much time on low-value-added tasks such as provisioning infrastructure, running manual unit tests, and managing test data. Armed with that insight, it launched a series of new tools and automation projects to help with those tasks across the software development life cycle.",
            "The Developer Velocity Index (DVI) is a survey that measures an enterpriseâs technology, working practices, and organizational enablement and benchmarks them against peers. This comparison helps unearth specific areas of opportunity, whether in backlog management, testing, or security and compliance.",
            " For example, one company, well known for its technological prowess and all-star developers, sought to define standard working practices more thoughtfully for cross-team collaboration after discovering a high amount of dissatisfaction, rework, and inefficiency reported by developers.",
            " Assessing contributions by individuals to a teamâs backlog (starting with data from backlog management tools such as Jira, and normalizing data using a proprietary algorithm to account for nuances) can help surface trends that inhibit the optimization of that teamâs capacity. This kind of insight can enable team leaders to manage clear expectations for output and improve performance as a result. Additionally, it can help identify opportunities for individual upskilling or training and rethinking role distribution within a team (for instance, if a quality assurance tester has enough work to do). For example, one company found that its most talented developers were spending excessive time on noncoding activities such as design sessions or managing interdependencies across teams. In response, the company changed its operating model and clarified roles and responsibilities to enable those highest-value developers to do what they do best: code. Another company, after discovering relatively low contribution from developers new to the organization, reexamined their onboarding and personal mentorship program. ",
            " Based on industry standard capability maps, this score is a summary of the individual knowledge, skills, and abilities of a specific organization. Ideally, organizations should aspire to a âdiamondâ distribution of proficiency, with the majority of developers in the middle range of competency.",
            " This can surface coaching and upskilling opportunities, and in extreme cases call for a rethinking of talent strategy. For example, one company found a higher concentration of their developers in the ânoviceâ capability than was ideal. They deployed personalized learning journeys based on specific gaps and were able to move 30 percent of their developers to the next level of expertise within six months. ",
            "As valuable as it can be, developer productivity data can be damaging to organizations if used incorrectly, so itâs important to avoid certain pitfalls. In our work we see two main types of missteps occur: misuse of metrics and failing to move past old mindsets. ",
            "Misuse is most common when companies try to employ overly simple measurements, such as lines of code produced, or number of code commits (when developers submit their code to a version control system). Not only do such simple metrics fail to generate truly useful insights, they can have unintended consequences, such as leaders making inappropriate trade-offs. For example, optimizing for lead time or deployment frequency can allow quality to suffer. Focusing on a single metric or too simple a collection of metrics can also easily incentivize poor practices; in the case of measuring commits, for instance, developers may submit smaller changes more frequently as they seek to game the system. ",
            "To truly benefit from measuring productivity, leaders and developers alike need to move past the outdated notion that leaders âcannotâ understand the intricacies of software engineering, or that engineering is too complex to measure. The importance of engineering talent to a companyâs success, and the ",
            ", underscores the need to acknowledge that software development, like so many other things, requires measurement to be improved. Further, attracting and retaining top software development talent depends in large part on providing a workplace and tools that allow engineers to do their best work and encourages their creativity. Measuring productivity at a system level enables employers to see hidden friction points that impede that work and creativity. ",
            "The mechanics of building a developer productivity initiative can seem daunting, but there is no time like the present to begin to lay the groundwork. The factors driving the need to elevate the conversation about software developer productivity to C-level leaders outweigh the impediments to doing so. ",
            "The increase in remote work and its popularity among developers is one overriding factor. Developers have long worked in agile teams, collaborating in the same physical space, and some technology leaders believe that kind of in-person teamwork is essential to the job. However, the digital tools that are so central to their work made it easy to switch to remote work during the pandemic lockdowns, and as in most sectors, this shift is hard to undo. As remote and hybrid working increasingly becomes the norm, organizations will need to rely on broad, objective measurements to maintain confidence in these new working arrangements and ensure they are steadily improving the function that could easily determine their future success or failure. The fact that the markets are now putting greater emphasis on efficient growth and ROI only makes it more important than ever to know how they can optimize the performance of their highly valued engineering talent. ",
            "Another key driver of this need for greater visibility is the rapid advances in AI-enabled tooling, especially large-language models such as generative AI. These are already rapidly changing the way work is done, which means that measuring software developersâ productivity is only a first step to understanding how these valuable resources are deployed. ",
            "But as critical as developer productivity is becoming, companies shouldnât feel they have to embark on a massive, dramatic overhaul almost overnight. Instead, they can begin the process with a number of key steps:",
            " All C-suite leaders who are not engineers or who have been in management for a long time will need a primer on the software development process and how it is evolving.",
            "Because developer productivity has not typically been measured at the level needed to identify improvement opportunities, most companiesâ tech stacks will require potentially extensive reconfiguration. For example, to measure test coverage (the extent to which areas of code have been adequately tested), a development team needs to equip their codebase with a tool that can track code executed during a test run. ",
            " As with most analytics initiatives, getting lost in mountains of data is a risk. Itâs important to start with one area that you know will result in a clear path to improvement, such as identifying friction points and bottlenecks. Be explicit about the scope of such a plan, as even the best approaches, no matter how comprehensive, will not be a silver bullet.",
            "The point is to look at an entire system and understand how it can work better by improving the development environment at the system, team, or individual level. ",
            "No matter the specific approach, measuring productivity should ideally create transparency and insights into key improvement areas. Only then can organizations build specific initiatives to drive impact for both developer productivity and experienceâimpact that will benefit both those individuals and the company as a whole.",

        "title": "Is MENAP’s budding start-up ecosystem ready to blossom?",
        "description": "Some of the world’s wealthiest venture capital investors call the region home, but it has not been a hot spot for start-ups. Now powerful trends are shifting this dynamic.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " some of the worldâs wealthiest, most active global investors, the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan (MENAP) region has historically had a relatively small, immature start-up ecosystem. Sovereign wealth funds (SWF) alone, for instance, manage some $3.3 trillion in assets, yet founders in the region have had difficulty attracting funding. Lately, however, there are some encouraging signs that this misalignment of capital supply and demand may be starting to dissipate, with the regionâs entrepreneurial environment poised to come into its own.",
            "Powerful forces are fueling this potential turnaround. MENAPâs more than 600-million-strong population is young, digitally savvy, and increasingly urban; they have embraced technology as consumers and innovators. At the same time, governments are assessing opportunities to modernize and diversify their economies in ways that could benefit the start-up ecosystem through national strategies and concerted regulatory efforts.",
            "While challenges in the region remain, all stakeholders can play a part in overcoming them. This article aims to help them better understand those challenges, the untapped potential of the MENAP venture market, and what it will take for the region to become a genuinely global start-up ecosystem.",
            "As a destination for institutional capital, MENAP remains a nascent frontier: public-market capitalizations are at 32 percent of GDP",
            " versus 98 percent globally, and VC investments are at 0.1 percent of GDP versus 0.8 percent globally.",
            "In some respects, however, the venture landscape in MENAP has made great strides of late. Annual venture capital (VC) funding has grown five times since 2017, reaching $3.45 billion in 2022. Since 2019, eight start-ups have reached the valuation milestone of more than $1 billion, with the average time it takes to attain âunicornâ status shrinking from 12 years to around three years (Exhibit 1). The massive success of the first regional unicorn, ",
            ", helped build conviction among founders and investors, driving a wave of new start-up activity. Careem alums are behind more than 50 MENAP start-ups, which have collectively raised over $2.3 billion. MENAP is now home to some 15 venture builders, supporting more than 230 start-ups across the region.",
            "Moreover, the region has plenty of room to grow, considering the state of other emerging market hot spots. For instance, in Southeast Asia and Latin America, VC investments as a share of GDP are at 0.8 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively. With MENAP still at 0.1 percent, there is an implied potential of four to eight times growth over the coming years. The region has also shown relative resilience amid the recent global slowdown in venture activity. In the fourth quarter of 2022, MENAP funding remained at nine times first-quarter 2017 levels (peaking in the first quarter of 2022 at 13 times), while global VC funding slowed to roughly twice first-quarter 2017 levels, down from a peak of 5.7 times in the fourth quarter of 2021 (Exhibit 2).",
            "Despite that recent momentum, many VC investors are still playing it safe in the region. Investors are typically drawn to the âusual suspectsâ; the top ten start-ups account for 35 to 55 percent of funding each year, versus around 10 percent in the United States, and the same eight start-ups have multiple top ten appearances in the past five years.",
            " The concentration of capital is such that while funding grew 7 percent in 2022, the number of deals actually fell from 725 to 703 (Exhibit 3).",
            "Another sign of this reluctance to take more significant risks and embrace less proven innovators is the much-steadier growth in mid- and late-stage funding. From 2017 to 2021, the number of series B deals grew roughly 34 percent, and the average deal value rose 17 percent per year. By comparison, over the same period, the number of early-stage deals grew by just 7 percent annually, while the number of series A deals fell by 1 percent. For the region to become a source of true innovation (and not a fast follower or copycat), a more consistent pipeline of new start-ups and investors willing to support them is likely needed.",
            "While MENAPâs VC market is often regarded as a bloc, it is far from monolithic. In terms of venture investing environments, the region is home to three distinct categories of countries. The first, such as Qatar and Kuwait, is considered âcapital rich,â owing to its relatively small populations and physical size yet significant, resource-driven GDPs. Others, most notably Egypt and Pakistan, are classified as âopportunity richâ because of their large and growing populations, particularly their young and increasingly digitally savvy population. Finally, there are also âhybridâ markets, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), endowed with plentiful capital, land, and population.",
            "Still, despite that diversity, a relatively select group commands the attention of most investors. Four of the regionâs 18 countriesâUAE, KSA, Egypt, and Pakistanâhave captured 90 percent of the funding since 2018. The UAE attracts the lionâs share, 34 percent, with KSA a close second at 29 percent. While all four markets enjoyed triple-digit growth between 2020 and 2021, KSA, Egypt, and Pakistan drove most of the growth from 2017 to 2020 (50 to 100 percent CAGRs); the UAE, by contrast, grew at just 4 percent CAGR over the same period.",
            "Maturity also varies across countries. The UAEâs average deal size in 2021 was $7.7 million, while KSAâs was $6.8 million, almost double that of the 16 other major markets ($2.8 million to $4.4 million). A higher share of late-stage deals primarily drove their larger deal sizes. The funding patterns across countries also differ by business model. Activity in Pakistan and KSA is dominated by B2C and B2B, respectively, while investors in the UAE are focusing their bets on âecosystem playsâ with hybrid business models, such as online marketplaces, that connect suppliers and consumers (Exhibit 4). Egypt, for its part, is split relatively evenly between all three business models.",
            "From a sector perspective, 80 percent of funding since 2018 has been in food and beverage, fintech, transport and logistics, and e-commerce. This concentration is mirrored in each of the regionâs four primary markets, although the top sector differs, reflecting different macroeconomic circumstances. Food and beverage, for instance, is a clear leader in the UAE, given its high-income, expat-dominated population. At the same time, fintech, which requires scale, does best in Egypt and KSA, given their larger populations (Exhibit 5).",
            "Many of the most prevalent sectors in MENAP, such as transport and e-commerce, tend to be âwinner takes all,â and there is no dearth of competition for the regionâs start-ups, especially with their lack of relative scale. Global players are increasingly penetrating the region, in some cases by acquiring local copycats, such as Amazonâs purchase of Souq. While such consolidation could present an attractive exit strategy for start-ups and investors, too many copycats may also limit the global, disruptive potential of regional start-ups.",
            "As the market evolves, these same sectors will likely not maintain such a grip. Our research suggests it takes three to ten years for new or trendy VC target sectors to move from more mature global markets to emerging ones such as the MENAP region. An analysis of global VC capital-flow momentum and deal count over 2020 to 2021 reveals seven high-momentum themes that are nascent but have strong potential to take off over the next decade. They are agtech, cybersecurity, sustainability, VR and gaming, beauty and wellness, healthcare, and advanced materials and manufacturing, many of which are already generating interest and support from the public sector in MENAP countries.",
            "The region is host to four major archetypes of investors, and all are growing: regional VC funds, international investors, SWF and government-backed funds, and family offices:",
            "If the MENAP region is poised for breakout growth, investors may want to consider how best to position themselves to appeal to local entrepreneurs and get access to the most promising ventures. Each founder and start-up chooses investing partners based on more than just the numbers. In our research, four investor attributes, besides the ability to provide capital, stood out as particularly beneficial for the region:",
            " to participate in the budding ecosystem may want to consider more than which sectors or specific start-ups are most promising. They can also assess the route to monetization, which is not clear-cut in a region where local capital markets are relatively underdeveloped. That said, a few paths have already proven successful, and others hold promise for the future.",
            "Private exits account for the overwhelming majority of exitsâ98 percent in 2022, to be precise. These transactions include sales to local strategic buyers (for example, Namshi acquired by Noon) and market-entry plays by global players such as Amazon and Uber.",
            "On the public side, start-ups can consider a local listing (for instance, Fawry listing in Egypt) or an offshore listing directly. While we have yet to see many mature ventures listed on the regionâs key exchanges (ADX, DFM, and Tadawul), regional IPOs could become more abundant. Between 2021 and 2022, the UAE listed eight sovereign-owned entities, including the Dubai Electricity and Water Authorityâthe stateâs largest IPO. The neighboring KSAâs Tadawul has made strides in recent years, introducing regulatory changes that granted MSCI inclusion, executing the worldâs largest IPO to date of Saudi Aramco, and aiming to push for more than 20 IPOs in 2025.",
            "As in any emerging market, policy makers could play a key role in developing the MENAP VC ecosystem to compete globally. For example, more mature markets, such as Singapore and the United Kingdom, have roughly five times as many former chief technology officers in the workforce as the UAE, MENAPâs most mature market. National programs to attract and develop top-tier tech talent will likely be critical in growing the ecosystem; so is developing future founders by exposing workers to innovation grant opportunities, training for priority skills needed in start-ups, top-tier university programs, and events to connect the community. (Of course, the private sector also has a role to play in educating the workforce through leadership development programs, internal incubators, and professional trainingâencouraging them to pursue entrepreneurial feats alongside the company.) Policy makers can also help guide entrepreneurs by articulating core investment themes and identifying and incentivizing the major white spaces where innovation matters.",
            "For local start-ups to become global disruptors, they would likely benefit from access to the entire region to test and enhance their offering while also driving innovation; such a broad and unified market is significantly more attractive than the individual countries that make up MENAP. Likewise, strong capital markets and greater liquidity are crucial to building these global disruptors. Coordinated regulatory changes could help unlock cross-border opportunities and deepen capital markets.",
            "Despite being home to some of the worldâs wealthiest, most active venture capital investors, the MENAP region historically has not been a hot spot for start-ups or a magnet for VC investment. But powerful trends, from growing, tech-savvy populations to more innovation-friendly policies, are shifting this dynamic. The MENAP venture space is growing and looking more promising, yet the next three to five years will be critical in creating a sustainable and robust start-up ecosystem that can reach its full potential.",

        "paragraphs": [
            " Africaâs largest wireless telecom provider, Ralph Mupita is all too aware of the connectivity gap the continent faces and the negative effects it has on development and growth. But unlike many other observers, Mupita views the relatively low rates of smartphone penetration and broadband access as a significant opportunity to drive digital inclusion that will underpin the socio-economic development of the continent. In his mind, new investments in digital infrastructure will enable the continent to âleapfrogâ its current hurdles and make seismic advances in everything from education to healthcare to agriculture, logistics, mining, and other industries. âAt MTN we deeply believe that everybody deserves the benefits of a modern connected life,â Mupita said in a recent interview with McKinsey senior partners Wajih Abou-Zahr and Acha Leke, and associate partner Mandisa Mazibuko. In the wide-ranging discussion, Mupita spoke about such topics as industry regulation and consolidation, MTN Groupâs new operating model, the war for talent, and his own affinity for wearing traditional African garb. The edited conversation appears below.",
            " How do you view the future of the telecom industry in Africa?",
            " I am generally very optimistic about the industryâs role and impact in Africa for several reasons.",
            "First, we are still in the early stages of digital adoption and financial inclusion here, so there is much room for growth. Only about 50 percent of our customers use smartphones, for instance, and some donât use data services. As for financial inclusion, the majority of the population doesnât have access to financial services. Fintech providers have made real progress, as has our mobile money business, one of the biggest on the continent, but the work to deliver a decent suite of financial services solutions is at an early stage of development.",
            "The other thing that fuels my optimism is the youthfulness of the African population, whose median age is 19. Considering the global workforce structure over the next 20 to 30 years, a sizeable share of the skilled tech workers we need will come from this continent.",
            " Africa has faced some real challenges in recent years. In what ways can telecom and tech help to overcome some of them?",
            " Yes, the last two to three years have been especially tough, with the aftershocks of COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, and resulting inflation having a disproportionate impact on Africa. But I see enormous potential for Africans to leapfrog the current hurdles and emerge stronger and more determined to meet the aspirations of sustainable and inclusive social and economic development laid out in the Africa 2063 Agenda. Digital infrastructure services and related technologies have a significant role in achieving those goals.",
            "That means, first and foremost, ensuring everyone has broadband access. It is essential for driving up the quality of life. There should be no child in any rural village across the African continent who does not have access to, letâs say, quality educational content just because of their familyâs or communityâs plight and financial condition.",
            "Digital infrastructure can also have a significant impact on health and health outcomes. Just think of the number of Africans who die because theyâre poor and lack access to medical attention. E-health and telemedicine could change that.",
            "Agriculture is another area thatâs a no-brainer. Technology can help transform the yields and production that can come out of this continent. Some 70 percent of all arable land globally thatâs not cultivated is on this continent. I also get excited about how 5G can improve critical areas like mining, ports, and logistics. In Africa, the industrial applications of 5G will arguably be more important than the consumer use cases such as streaming and gaming. How do we make mining safer and more productive with private networks, for example, or how do we change the skillsets we have in the industry? How can 5G help accelerate the growth of oil and manufacturing in Africa?",
            " You mentioned the importance of expanding broadband access across Africa. What will it take to help make this a reality?",
            " Yes, the connectivity gap across Africa needs to be tackled in many ways. We believe that everybody deserves the benefits of a modern connected life.",
            "The rolling out of terrestrial networks across Africa has progressed relatively well, but thereâs still more work to be done. Weâve got to think about how that is complemented by the non-terrestrial networks, such as LEO-based satellite constellations, that are beginning to emerge. Fiberization of the network is also crucial and will require a massive investment. The shift from 4G to 5G creates this convergence of fixed and wireless, and to enable that, a massive network of fiber railroads will need to be laid across the continent to connect the Cape to Cairo.",
            "The final point is the cost of handsets and services. Handsets are still relatively expensive for most Africans, which also creates challenges for delivering a decent return and investing with a long-term horizon. We believe that the inflection point will occur when everybody can afford to consume 10GB per month, on a smartphone priced at $20. At that price point, you will see another surge of growth. With that growth, and the infrastructure available, we can ensure that Africa does not get left behind in this technology transition.",
            " Tell us about Ambition 2025, your companyâs new strategy and delayered operating model.",
            " So, part of the rationale for Ambition 2025 is to ensure that we are positioned to capture growth much faster. In this model, we are moving from being just a telecommunications company to being a set of interconnected technology platforms. Connectivity is in and of itself a platform, but that connectivity works quite well as an adjacency to our other platforms, such as fintech, digital services, or instant messaging application Ayoba. Each platform requires a different operating model, financial and capital structure, risk profile, talent requirements, and incentives and compensation structure. We structure each of these platforms so that it can move as quickly as possible to capture the opportunity without losing the benefit of being part of the broader group. These businesses will continue to move forward, but they will move forward at different speeds and with varying degrees of required agility. Structuring our businesses in this way and seeking strategic partnerships where it makes sense will make us nimbler as an organization and remain at the forefront of driving digital and financial inclusion.",
            "We actually started the delayering many years ago when we carved out all towers. But the direction weâre going in now is to carve out our fintech business, and weâre looking at carving out fiber as well. These are trends that we think are really important to lean into, trends that will provide customers with better service and better enable us to monetize the current technology transformation and position us to be able to win in the future. So, we are very, very excited about delayering.",
            "The second aspect of Ambition 2025 is really around simplifying the group. We are moving out of certain geographies, such as the Middle East to focus all our human and financial capital on opportunities in Africa. We are also simplifying the balance sheet, which will give us the ability to absorb shocks as well as the financial flexibility to take on growth opportunities as and when they come.",
            "The final part is that an enormous amount of value is hidden within the company and not fully reflected in the share price. It is up to us to reveal this value to our capital providers.",
            " To what extent will the state of regulation affect the success of this strategy as well as that of Africaâs broad technology-driven transformation?",
            " There is an urgent need for more harmonized and modern regulatory frameworks across Africa.",
            "Regulation is a potential massive driver of the growth and transformation of the industry. The regulatory frameworks that we have had over the last 20 years have served us very well. They were designed in the transition era from voice to data, basically from 2G to 3G technology.",
            "But these regulatory frameworks are not fit for the future, and without change will keep Africa behind as the rest of the world advances. They are based on a belief that you need four to five or even six-player markets when we see consolidation globally in many markets.",
            "Just as important, current regulations are still framed from the perspective of wireless versus fixed. In reality, a convergence of these technologies is taking place and is moving much faster than the regulation.",
            "And another aspect, which is a real issue on the African continent, is a lack of harmonization of regulatory frameworks as you move from country to country. So, how you approach spectrum acquisition in Country X and Country Y, which might even be neighbors, needs to be quite different. Itâs very challenging for us as a multinational operator in 19 markets where the regulations differ from country to country.",
            "Modernizing and evolving regulations is critical for creating a more attractive climate for global capital. Many estimates show that the continent needs $100 billion in capital investments to meet the goal of universal broadband by 2030, but what is being spent now is insufficient.",
            " Why do you feel consolidation is bound to happen?",
            " At least in our markets, we believe consolidation is inevitable and necessary. Most markets still have four or more operators licensed to operate and provide full infrastructure and services to their customers. But given the capital required for all those operators to have their own infrastructure, spectrum and other assets, the profit pools to be generated in any one market and potential returns are just too small to support that many operators.",
            "And if you look back at the last decade or so, the challenge for the industry, both globally and in Africa, has been delivering a return on invested capital that exceeds the cost of capital. So, we believe many markets with four or five players will move to three, and sometimes you might even move to two operators with the infrastructure and the services layer. And this could, in turn, create more scope for companies to focus on providing only digital services whilst leveraging the infrastructure of two or so fully integrated operators in a market.",
            "As part of our strategy and vision for 2025, weâve built an instant messaging app thatâs now reached more than 20 million monthly active users. We still have a long way to go to meet our ambition of 100 million. But that 20 million milestone has been something we celebrated internally, and we are arranging our own portfolio of digital services, including music, video, and gaming, that we can offer our customers rather than just raw data.",
            " Speaking of services, are there lessons the industry can learn from the last ten years to help create more success and value in the coming years?",
            " If you go back maybe ten, maybe even 15 years, the industry was financially in a very good place. Top-line growth was driving strong cash generation and returns, especially with the shift from 2G to 3G, and there was very little debt on balance sheets.",
            "But from the time the iPhone came into existence, most, if not all, of the value went to the over-the-top (OTT) players, such as streaming services and instant messaging apps that used the digital infrastructure without contributing in any material way to the cost of that infrastructure. The lesson to be learned is that governments and regulators need to think about a different framework so that all participants in or beneficiaries of the digital infrastructure are paying their fair share toward digital investment and regulatory fees and taxes. Operators are bearing too big a burden on investment and fiscal contributions.",
            " The telecom sector was long viewed as one of the top training grounds for talent, but the war for talent has gotten more challenging in recent years, especially with banks and finance, other tech companies, and OTTs all proving very attractive. How do you think operators can regain their position as a talent magnet, and how does Ambition 2025 help you get there?",
            " The war for talent is going to be an unrelenting one. Ensuring that we have the right people and that those people find meaning in their work when they come to MTN is our top priority as an executive team as we go through this transformation. Ambition 2025 creates a new, stronger foundation for attracting and retaining talent.",
            "Take the fintech business that we are carving out, for example. It has its own staff and talent profile needed for success in the future. In the past, people who have worked in financial services might not have even considered working at MTN, a telecommunications provider. But now they donât have to think about us only in that context. They can say, âWell, Iâm interested in whatâs happening with the fintech business. This business has scale, itâs creating exciting new products, and itâs expanding into new marketsâ.",
            "As we move through different technology cycles, the skills we need to have in abundance are changing. Software development and engineering have become much more important in our company than just three or four years ago. The ability to use big data and AI to make decisions, run your network, and run your company will also be in greater demand.",
            " You mentioned the importance of employees finding meaning in their jobs at your company. To what extent do ESG and issues like sustainability play a role in that sense of meaning?",
            " We operate in some of the most challenging markets on the continent. Our belief is that by driving digital and financial inclusion we are giving Africans opportunities, dignity, and hope. And the journey weâre going through is then ultimately really about being mission-driven, with people and culture as the most important drivers of success.",
            "I often tell the teams that if we are honest with ourselves, much of what weâre doing is easy to copy, whether itâs the strategy or technology. But what makes MTN different, what is very difficult to replicate, is the people, culture, and the diversity and inclusion that we have within the company. Itâs a group of deeply committed people who believe in the mission of the company, and I think that is a little bit of the edge that this all gives us.",
            "One of the strategic pillars of Ambition 2025 is what we call creating shared value. And you know, we put ESG at the core in that regard. So, weâve arranged ourselves to be quite programmatic around how we think about creating shared value and all the elements of it and managing it in such a way that we will meet our aspirations.",
            "For example, on the environment, weâve pushed very hard around our commitments to decarbonize our networks and our operation to meet the net zero goal by 2040 and material reduction of emissions by 2030.",
            "Weâve also put much emphasis on lowering the cost to communicate, diversity and inclusion. On diversity and inclusion, we are focused on increasing female participation in the workforce and in leadership roles towards 50 percent. We are currently just on 40 percent workforce participation. We are also focused on dealing with gender pay parity.",
            "In our core connectivity business, as we move from 3G to 4G in some markets and 4G to 5G in others, thereâs a lot of potential to contribute to socio-economic development. I really get excited about the power of the industrial internet through 5G and what that will do to transform the African continent. And for people who have a similar passion, who are inspired by that vision of MTN playing a role in driving economic transformation, coming to MTN creates an exciting and long-term future.",
            " What are some of your interests or hobbies outside of work, and how do they shape your thinking about your role at MTN?",
            " Formula One is a passion of mine. I try to get to go to a race at least once a year. Not always possible but I try! Thereâs a lot to learn from that sport around pushing boundaries, finding new realities, teamwork, and the role technology can play to drive performance.",
            "At a different pace altogether, I used to run marathons. And the biggest lesson Iâve taken from that has been the importance of setting clear goals, self-awareness, and the discipline of putting in the mileage and pacing yourself to help achieve them. I think self-awareness and pacing are key attributes of great marathon runners, and those traits apply to business as well. If you are deeply self-aware, disciplined, and pace yourself well, you can get through many challenges, a lot of ups and downs, over time, even when you encounter the proverbial walls that every marathon runner will talk aboutâand these are some of the parallels Iâve experienced myself in business.",
            " Finally, we almost always see you wearing traditional African attire in public engagements. Whatâs the story and inspiration behind that?",
            " Once in Lagos, a then-fellow board member, Tunde Falowiyo, introduced me to a talented tailor named Olajire. And from that moment on, I started to mostly wear beautiful, well-tailored clothing from African tailors and designers.",
            "Part of it is the pride in being African and the fact that I can make a difference. And the other part is practical. Traditional clothing, our caftans, are much more suited for our markets than Western suits. But I dress like this outside of the African borders as well. I love expressing my Africanness and supporting our great artists and tailors across the continent.",

            " Andrey Khusid, co-founder and CEO of Miro, puts a premium on experimentation and collaboration. Khusid founded Miro in 2011 to empower people and companies to create âthe next big thing.â As Miro has scaled to serve 99 percent of Fortune 100 companies, Khusidâs pioneering methods for company and leadership organization have disrupted the traditional hierarchical structure companies have relied on to create leads, growth, profit, and relationships. The ethos powering Miroâs software and its company has become even more relevant as remote and hybrid work models have grown in popularity and practicality across sectors.",
            "Khusid sat down with McKinsey partner Mina Alaghband and senior partner Paul Roche, who leads the firmâs global software practice, to talk about his agile organizational philosophy, layering marketing and sales into a PLG model, customer-centric business practices, and how âhand-raisersâ drive product adoption and proliferation. The edited conversation appears below.",
            " Andrey, can you start by discussing how you founded Miro and the growth story up to today?",
            " Oleg Shardin and I founded Miro in 2011 with the simple idea of bringing a whiteboard into a browser. Since then, it has developed into a major visual collaboration platform that supports critical workflows for enterprises of all sizes. âVisual collaborationâ is a new term meaning people can communicate visually, compared with what they can do through messaging platforms, video, or audio. A picture is worth a thousand words, that was the initial idea behind Miro. Today we serve 99 percent of Fortune 100 companies and more than 50 million users, working across 12 offices.",
            " Tell us about the mission of and vision for Miro.",
            " We are building a company, a platform, that empowers teams across the world to create the next big thing. Thatâs what excites all of us here at Miro. When we thought about our name, we asked, âHow can we be inspirational for every person out there?â And we came up with the name Miro in association with Joan Miro, the artist. We want to bring people the joy of being artists during their day to day jobs when they brain dump ideas or create complex visualizations on an infinite canvas. We want to empower people to play their best game, to create the next big thing.",
            " What attributes are key to building a successful PLG motion or engine?",
            " PLG starts with the product and product distribution. You need to focus on your user and customer and remove all the friction they could face in their journey to be purely product-led. For us, this means customers can sign up for free and buy the product by themselves on the website. They can have an unlimited number of users and share boards with external collaborators.",
            "We started off with two teams: One team was responsible for delivering major chunks of value and what users need. This team was roadmapâdriven. The second team was distributing and monetizing the value, optimizing for the funnel. This team was experimentation-driven, focused on questions such as how customers can activate additional value themselves, how can this value drive engagement, how can it be monetized, and how can it drive new user referrals.",
            "There was no conflict because the teams were resourced simultaneously. They worked very closely with each other because they needed to understand what type of value was being created at what stage of the user journey, what friction points they could remove, and so on. But at the same time, we resourced them separately so they could run their own playbooks.",
            "I see more and more of this kind of approach today, but I think itâs still rare.",
            " How do companies that donât have a ton of telemetry or SaaS offerings capitalize on a PLG strategy?",
            " In collaboration software we have the privilege of natural virality, assuming itâs done right. You can, for example, sell volumes of usage rather than seats. Users can test the productâeven set up a team and start to use the productâwithout swiping their credit card. But I personally believe that PLG can be developed with any type of product and company, it doesnât have to be a collaboration-focused software or product. The key is deciding how you want to interact with your customers and build your product organization.",
            " It sounds like itâs about having an experimentation mindset but being disciplined in how you apply that approach to product development and customer engagement. Is that right?",
            " Itâs a customer-centric approach, plus experimentation. But it only works if you truly believe in it. You canât just read the cookbook; you have to be excited about getting into the kitchen to make something special. Thatâs where it starts.",
            " One common trend in PLG start-ups is that, as they scale, they tend to incorporate more traditional elements of Go-to-Market with marketing, sales reps, and customer success. Has that been the case for you?",
            " We started with a B2C2B model. In the past five years, we added marketing to this model, which helps us generate the pipeline for sales. We reach out to users to check if they need help or have any needs that we may be able to serve with one of our other tier plans. On top of that, we started to layer our sales machine. Teams are aligned around different stages and sizes of companies. The sales non machine then prioritizes the most promising opportunities out of the leads that we generate. So, we have this âintegrated motionâ between product, marketing, sales, and customer success. Every part plays a role in building the business.",
            " How has this addition of marketing and sales to the pure PLG approach changed your efficiency and growth?",
            " To build a strong, durable business, you need to be customer-centric. By adding marketing and sales layers on top of PLG, we increased our investment in customers, since before, it had been a transactional, self-service business. By doing that, we increased the depth of relationships we have with those customers, and we increased the breadth of customers that we can serve. It also impacted our reputation in the market.",
            "The key questions are: âHow can you build an efficient business with these different motions? What do you need to drive through PLG and self-service?â and âWhere do you need to pay your most expensive sales reps?â You need to experiment continuously to find the answers. Weâre at the beginning of the experimentation journey, looking for the most efficient ways to combine these motions.",
            " Letâs talk more about the top of the funnel. How do you identify leads?",
            " Most of our business comes from what we call âhand-raisersâ: people who adopted the product and are ready to talk with someone to take it to the next level of adoption in their company. Some people are ready to talk and reach out, but some people donât consider reaching out to the sales team, so our marketing team is also working to generate those leads through marketing campaigns, targeting certain strategic personas in our user pool.",
            " How do you pinpoint the most promising hand-raisers?",
            " We treat lead generation as a product and continuously improve it. We have spent a lot of time assessing the best moment to reach out, how mature the account should be, and the most effective way to connect.",
            "We use a complex model to generate Product Qualified Accounts [PQAs] and then reach out to start to build relationships.",
            " You have some cool organizational hacks that we havenât really seen in many other places in the industry. Letâs talk about your âgrowth pods.â What are they and how are they used?",
            " The idea is to align and build pods around the organizationâs value streams. Employees from success, marketing, product, design, engineering, and sales come together to solve complex problems such as, âHow can we have twice as many hand-raisers?â Then those people hack and iterate together.",
            "We still need to scale this approach, but so far, itâs been beneficial for the culture of the company. People understand what theyâre aligned around, the mission of the team, and the value they create in the business. But they have to be set up for success in terms of roles and responsibilities, rituals, and enablement.",
            " Can you give an example of one cross-functional pod and how the team worked together?",
            " We created a pod of people who can influence usage. It was made up of individuals from marketing, customer education, product, engineering, and customer success. They worked together towards the shared goal of driving usage and came up with a backlog of ideas for what could be impactful around this metric. They set a regular meeting cadence, established ways of communicating, and developed an approach, including how many experiments they wanted to run. When they discovered something that seemed to have an impact on usage, the approach was taken out of the pod and scaled.",
            "We have another pod built around what we call Miroverse. This is a platform for content that our user community generates, with the goal of democratizing the best practices of how to drive innovation. This pod includes a cross-functional group of folks from product marketing, product growth, growth engineering, and community marketing. They experiment to grow a metric like âengaged community members,â the users who create and consume the most content. We started working on this in April of 2020, and since then, Miroverse has experienced tremendous growth and become an autonomous, self-sustaining community engine.",
            " How are people picked for the pods, and what does their work look like once they get in one? How long do their roles last?",
            " We try to create pods around topics that are long-lasting, not short-term. For us, âlong-lastingâ is six to 12 months and more. People work in the pods full-time. The belief is that they need to be fully dedicated, focusing on one metric that they want to move further. We try to bring people who have a growth mindset, who are oriented toward experimentation, and who are ready to try different things. They need to be able to operate in an entrepreneurial way, where theyâre figuring things out rather than building specific solutions.",
            "Given that the company is relatively new, most pods are forming through external hiring. We try to bring people who will be excited to work together, who have diverse backgrounds and skills, but not just based on subject-matter expertise. We want folks with different ways of working, creativity, and resourcefulness. We want to form teams, not groups of people. An autonomous team should have all the competencies inside it.",
            " With all these autonomous pods driving much of the impact in the business, what is the role of functional leaders?",
            " The whole organization is not in pods; we have a mixed model. We have individual contributors and some more streamlined operations. On a leadership level we are trying to operate as company leaders, not functional leaders. We have a Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Product Officer, Chief People Officer, and others, but they are company leaders who have to do whatâs best for the company. They may be a sponsor of a pod, like our Chief Customer Officer is for the usage pod or our Chief Financial Officer might be for a pricing pod. It goes way beyond the traditional âarea of responsibility.\" Their job, broadly speaking, is to create a successful strategically aligned organization with a durable foundation for growth.",
            "This is a complex model, and we still sometimes struggle with it. Itâs way easier to operate in an environment where marketing does marketing, sales does sales, success does success. But the most efficient organizations create this complex cake where PLG is layered with marketing, and sales, and success together. The roles and processes are not traditional.",
            "Thereâs a performance and leadership coach who won a gold medal with the British rowing team in the 2000 Summer Olympics, [Ben Hunt-Davis]. His key principle is: âWill it make the boat go faster?â When I think about the future of the organization, and organizational design, thatâs the principle I apply to leadership: will it make the boat go faster?",
            " Is the growth pod model something that you can do because youâre a tech company thatâs fast-growing and still medium-sized? Or is that something that you can see larger, non-tech companies adopting?",
            " I think that this kind of approach is relevant to all sizes of companies and to complex problem-solving.",
            "Every organization in the world wants to solve more problems because thatâs where you have the potential to monetize as a first mover. Many big corporations have trouble inventing big, new complex things, because they donât have the flat structure of a start-up. Our approach relies on having startups inside our organization, people who can figure out complex problems, and who can solve them faster through a low-ego culture, working towards a shared goal. A dedicated team is focused on a problem, and continuously iterates. I think this is applicable to everyone.",
            " How does the overall leadership structure work in your organization?",
            " Every office we have across the world is a primary office with a company leader in each one, not just an office leader. My leadership team is distributed across five of the 12 offices. The extended leadership team is distributed across all 12 offices.",
            "The challenge is that, especially when you are spread across all time zones, you need to build strong relationships so you can work together quickly. But because leaders are in key offices, the vibe is the same everywhere, and we have access to a global talent pool. We often bring the leadership team together to have strategic and social time, and that lessens the friction in terms of time zones. Then we can work through conflicts and problem solve more quickly.",
            " Iâve been in a bunch of CEO roundtables, and a bunch of board round tables, and thereâs been a strong view from those groups that having a distributed leadership team lowers productivity. Youâve experienced the opposite. What are some of the small things that you do to make it work for you?",
            " We spend time as a leadership team one week every quarter in a room together. Every time we travel to different hubs. And we have rituals. Every week, we have a business strategy-operational meeting; we call it the âleadership water cooler.â It has a packed agenda. We plan it two months ahead of time because itâs very expensive for us to meet. We try to build trust as much as possible. We run retrospectives, give direct feedback to each other, and we facilitate complex and uncomfortable conversations. We want to be a team who are invested in a shared journey, and who can have hard talks with each other. People really love and enjoy working in the leadership team. They are proud to work together.",
            " If your Chief Customer Officer is sponsoring pods, he or she is probably responsible for the hiring and oversight of the people in the pods, and the folks doing the day-to-day running of the business, right? How does that work for performance management and metrics?",
            " We align the organizational leadership around two metrics: users and revenue. Then five to eight people in a pod work toward one metric. Miroverse, for example, has engaged community users, which contributes to more engaged platform users, and ultimately to more revenue.",
            "You also need one leader who can look at your customer base holistically, not through your organizational chart. I donât want my customers to think, âOh, this email is from marketing, and this email from success, and this from renewals, and this from sales, and this from product.â I want my customer to interact with one company, not a bunch of different functions, so they get a streamlined experience. People need to have the right DNA for this type of setup. They have to be able to leave their ego at the door and not have ambitions of building their own kingdoms inside a company.",
            " How do you assess the success of your initiatives?",
            " We frame the initiatives that we come up with as hypotheses. You have to come up with âbest-guessâ hypotheses and test them as fast as possible to understand if they can bring you to the ultimate result, or you need to test something else, or you need to change the approach. If you start to build something, and then you see that leading indicators are not where they should be, you have to ask yourself: Is it the right solution for the problem? Is it being implemented correctly? Do we have the right people on the problem?",
            "Some parts of the organization are more advanced around this than others. We are on a journey.",
            " Given that Miroâs roles and business processes arenât traditional, how do you ensure your goals are making the boat go faster?",
            " First, I donât think that this setup âmakes the boat go fasterâ in the short- to middle-term. Itâs not only about going fast in specific areas; itâs also about going smart. We donât know the answers. The teams have to experiment with what drives the best outcomes. It might not be the fastest journey in the beginning, but itâs the most effective in the long run.",

Their edited conversation appears below:",
            " Tell us about Entrepreneur First. What does EF do?",
            " Entrepreneur First (EF) is a new kind of organization trying to increase the supply of great entrepreneurs globally. Our starting point is that the world is missing out on some of its best founders, and there are lots of places where there are brilliant people who could and maybe should be entrepreneurs, but the path into entrepreneurship in a lot of the world is not straightforward. There are cultural barriers, there are practical barriers, and there are financial barriers.",
            "At EF, we try and remove all those barriers by finding great people ",
            " they have a company. Weâre not a traditional VC, where we take pitches from start-ups that have a team and an idea. We start with the individualâwe call it âtalent investing.â We run a structured program for individuals to come together, find a co-founder, test, and validate an idea, take some money from us, and then go out into the world, ideally to build big and important companies.",
            " The start-up and investing landscape has evolved significantly since EF launched in 2011. How do you distinguish yourselves in an increasingly crowded market?",
            " Itâs fantastic that thereâs been this explosion of options for entrepreneurs. But most of the infrastructure for entrepreneursâincubators, accelerators, venture fundsâall assumes that the company already exists. It is almost as if they believe the supply of entrepreneurs and companies is fixed. At Entrepreneur First, we donât think the supply of entrepreneurs is fixed. We donât think the supply of great companies is fixed. The point of EF is not to fund things that already exist. Itâs to go from zero to one. We like to say that our mission is to make companies happen that otherwise wouldnât exist.",
            "The people that EF is right for are very ambitious and talented, and they know they want to have impact through entrepreneurship, but they still need to get someone in their network whoâs the right co-founder. They have an idea but are unsure whether itâs the right idea or even a good one. All these things are yet to be crystallized. So, you can think of EF as catalyzing entrepreneurship right at the beginning rather than taking something already working and giving it rocket fuel.",
            "People choose EF to join a peer group of people that do want to go on that journey. Over the last decade, we have devised a methodology for helping people start companies with strangers. Thatâs the core value proposition of EF.",
            " Tell us more about that journey to building EF and what you have learned.",
            " When Alice Bentinck and I started Entrepreneur First, one of the guiding principles was that betting on talent early was not just an important thing to do but the foundation of an entire ecosystem.",
            "We probably didnât realize how contrarian the idea was at the time. We didnât know that one of the mantras of Silicon Valley was, âDonât start a company with a stranger.â And so, building EF has been a journey of gradually producing proof points to show that this was not only possible but perhaps a better way of building companies.",
            "We started with very little funding. We then built a first cohort. It looked quite promising, and so we raised a small amount of money and ballooned from there. Today EF has raised close to half a billion dollars. Our companies have raised over a billion dollars of venture capital. And in that time, we scaled a lot. Today Entrepreneur First is 120 people across six countries, producing about 120 companies a year. And one of the great things is that the journey Alice and I have been on as founders very much mirrors the process that entrepreneurs we back go through as well.",
            " You and Alice have just written a book, ",
            ". What does it take to be a great founder?",
            " The first thing I always think about when asked what a great founder looks like is to start from the opposite perspective and say, âWhat isnât it?â",
            "One of the big myths is that great founders are genetically different, some breed apart, and itâs so obvious to them that they should be an entrepreneur that they donât consider anything else. Thatâs not true at all. A lot of the things that you would look for in a great founder are like what you would look for in a great executive in a bigger company, a great consultant, or really a great anything.",
            "The main things we look for are, âCan this person be a highly effective leader? Are they determined and resilient? Are they a great problem-solver?â These things are quite relevant across domains.",
            "Now, what makes a founder a founder as opposed to being an executive at a larger company? Well, again, a few things that itâs not. I donât think itâs risk appetite. Itâs hard to be a great exec if you donât have risk appetite.",
            "But one thing that great founders do have is a desire to create something from nothing. There are different phases that founders go through, and the phase we specialize in at EF is the zero-to-one phase. We are looking for very smart people, who have a natural bias to action, are very determined, and have a track record of making things happen. But weâre asking, âCan they make things happen in conditions of A, uncertainty, and B, almost no resources?â Some people are wildly successful but need certain resources and clarity about what theyâre doing. Entrepreneurs must be able to thrive without either of those.",
            " In the book, you discuss the idea of âedgeâ in founders. What is âedge,â how do people develop it, and how do you assess it?",
            " Because EF has to make an investment decision âpre-companyâ before we know what the founders will work on, we have to approach selection differently from a typical VC firm. Most VC firms are assessing the founder, but theyâre also asking, âHow big is this market?â, âWhat are the margins likely to be?â, âWhat is the competitive environment?â. We donât know any of that. We select people before they have an idea, which means we have to try and find some signal of what sorts of ideas they might be well-suited to work on.",
            "As a result, when assessing people, we look for what we call âedge.â And by edge, we mean a personal competitive advantage. We are fast forwarding six months and saying, âWhat in this personâs background, skills, experience, maybe even hobbies and interests, could six months from now be the foundation of a plausible story about building a big company?â",
            "An edge might be that you understand a particular technology well. For example, some of EFâs most prominent companies are built on a very deep understanding of machine learning and how to apply that knowledge. Edge can also come from domain experience. An individual has come out of a particular industry, for instance, where theyâve observed a big problem for which they think technology provides an answer.",
            " You are now at the point where you have invested in many companies over the last decade. What have you learned about what it takes to scale a start-up over that period?",
            " One interesting thing is that some roles within a start-up scale quite well as the company grows, and some donât. Prospective entrepreneurs should try to be clear-eyed about that.",
            "For example, this is probably obvious, but a great founding CEO can go all the way. And thatâs because a CEOâs job is primarily communicating a vision and a strategy and hiring great people.",
            "On the other hand, thereâs almost no way a company will scale if they donât upgrade the executive team over time. This reality is sometimes hard to confront when youâre a band of brothers and sisters in a basement. But when your company is only made up of five or ten individuals, they wonât be the same people as when youâre a company of 100 or 1000.",
            "Founders often have to reframe that kind of change as positive. Each stage, with each order of magnitude, requires a particular skill set. Running an engineering team of 1,000 engineers is very different from being a CTO as an individual contributor.",
            "What weâve learned over time is that self-knowledge is vital. Founders have to realize which bit of the journey or job they like. Some people want to go all the way through. But itâs OK if a founder says, âWeâve got to 100 people, we have leaders in place that are ready to go from 100 to 1,000, and itâs not me.â",
            " Like any early-stage investor, you have also seen many companies fail. What lessons have you learned about why that happens?",
            " I think itâs worth dividing failures into two categories. Sometimes the founding team do mess things up. They fail to execute, disastrously hire, or build a terrible culture. But this doesnât happen most of the time. There are very few companies in the EF portfolio that failed because of the way they executed. Much more common is what I would call âfundamental risk.â",
            "The whole point of a start-up is trying to do something that has yet to be done. But that means that a founding teamâs job is to progressively de-risk the assumptions baked into the idea. And successful startups are effectively the ones that find their assumptions were correct.",
            "You can think of the different rounds of financing that start-ups go through as various stages of de-risking different kinds of risk. What kind of risk is the one that most often kills companies? Well, early on, itâs, âIs this a thing at all?â Is the value proposition that you have in mind for the customer one that truly resonates with the customer? Will they pay for this thing that you think is valuable? In most cases, companies fail early on because the answer to those questions is no.",
            "And thatâs why both at EF and in the book, what we emphasize most is talking to your customers. Iâve never met a company that failed because it talked to its customers too much. Iâve met many that failed because they assumed they knew what their customers wanted and were wrong.",
            " Youâve also now invested in founders across various sectorsâfrom deep tech to food delivery. If you look out over the next five years, what sectors or specific technologies are you most excited about?",
            " One of the joys of talent investing is that we donât have to be too smart. People often ask, âOh, you see so many ideas; what ideas do you have?â The answer is that at EF, weâre very good at identifying talentâand the talent comes up with the ideas. That said, we must decide where to look for talent, so itâs true that we do have some thoughts on this.",
            "EF has been very lucky throughout the last ten years to have been early to the idea that machine learning would unlock significant capabilities that would be relevant across both consumer and enterprise applications. We started investing seriously in machine learning back in 2013. We are nine years from that, and it feels like machine learning is still the most important thing we care about today.",
            "Thereâs that wonderful Marc Andreessen phrase, âSoftware is eating the world.â You can now say, âMachine learning is eating the world.â And thatâs going to be true not only in the obvious ways but across sectors we might not see today as amenable to that approach. Machine learning is eating biology in interesting ways. Machine learning is eating energy in interesting ways.",
            "But in general, weâve learned that we should be prepared to be surprised. Whenever weâve tried to get too clever about thinking we can predict the future rather than identify the people who can predict the future, weâve messed up.",
            " Switching gears, the European start-up ecosystem has developed significantly over the last decade, but most people still believe it lags behind Silicon Valley. What is holding Europe back, and what is needed to overcome those challenges?",
            " It really is an extraordinary explosion. When we started Entrepreneur First in 2011, I think one fund in London was dedicated to seed investing. I donât know how many there are today, but when we run Demo Days, we get hundreds, if not thousands, of people, which wasnât the case when we started.",
            "Still, however bullish you are on the European sceneâand we obviously are, with three sites in London, Paris, and Berlinâthere is still a gap with what you see in Silicon Valley.",
            "Both the bullish and bearish answer is that the missing ingredient is time. People forget that Silicon Valley is not a â90s-born phenomenon; itâs a post-war phenomenon. The reason thatâs important is the power of the generational effect.",
            "Vibrant ecosystems recycle not only capital but talent. Once you have run a 1,000-person engineering team, not only can you do that again, but youâve probably trained ten people that can do that as well.",
            "And so, if you look at where Europe is still lacking, a lot of itâs just about the scaling infrastructure, which is both talent and to some extent, capital. The good news is that the generational effect is already happening in Europe. Ten years ago, nearly every venture investor in London had a pure finance background. They had come out of investment banking and private equity. Thereâs nothing wrong with that. Some of the great investors are from that background. But if you look at Silicon Valley, most well-known investors there, particularly more recently, are founders; theyâre operators. Thatâs happening in Europe now. So, I feel optimistic that most of what we need to see change will happen organically with time.",
            " The last decade has been an unprecedented period of global growth and relative stability. How would you advise start-ups to prepare for a possible period of economic turbulence ahead?",
            " Itâs true that a nontrivial part of the venture capital boom of the last decade or more has been driven by the ahistorical, close-to-zero interest rate environment. And itâs certainly true that capital allocators look to things like start-ups as a source of yield and growth in that kind of environment.",
            "However, concluding that this is a bad time to start a company would be wrong. For a seed-stage start-up, the source of risk is rarely the macro environment. Your source of risk is, âCan you convince one person they should be a customer?â When youâre just starting and looking for five customers, the general propensity among consumers of businesses to spend shouldnât be the thing that makes or breaks your company.",
            "Similarly, while late-stage financing has slowed down massively since last year, I see that much less at the early stage. Seed investors today are assuming that when those new companies eventually graduate to become big, established companies, the macro environment will be very different from today.",
            "I think we are going to see a period where some of the, letâs say, exuberant valuations of 2021 get corrected rather quickly for startups that built unsustainable businesses that assumed capital would be abundant at low cost forever.",
            "But for entrepreneurs starting their journey today, the macro environment is not that relevant. The most relevant thing is to talk to your customers and make sure youâre building something people want; then, hopefully, in six or seven years, when you need to raise that pre-IPO round, weâre in a very different world.",
            " Like many other early-stage investors, you are an optimist. As we approach a potential period of economic turbulence, where are the âgreen shootsâ to be optimistic about?",
            " When I first started EF, I realized very quickly that, one, it was very easy to pick holes in every start-up idea that I saw and, two, that there was almost no value in doing so. If you predict that a start-up will fail, youâre likely to be right, but there is no benefit to being right.",
            "One of our friends and investors at EF is Nat Friedman, who used to be the CEO of GitHub, and he has this great line, âPessimists sound smart. Optimists make money.â Most things do fail. But whatâs special about venture capital, whatâs special about start-ups, is that the winners are so big that it pays for everything else many times over.",
            "I would say that however pessimistic you are about the economy today or the fate of any given company, the real question to ask is, âDo you believe that the technologies that are emerging today are going to be more or less important ten years from now, and do you think that importance is going to manifest in the real economy or not?â",
            "Itâs hard to imagine that the sorts of things that weâre starting to see, particularly in AI, will not be important ten years from now and that they wonât filter through to the real economy. Many things will fail, but itâs hard not to believe weâre heading for a more productive and abundant world.",

        "description": "Hatem Dowidar discusses the source of his optimism about the telecom industry, the lessons of the recent past, and why the Middle Eastern and African operator required a radical organizational overhaul to position itself for future growth.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " Winning Through Turns, ",
            " telecommunications operators have spurred massive economic and social impacts. By covering nearly the entire world with data connectivity, they have enabled people everywhere to work, play, learn, socialize, and stay connected during the pandemic. Through it all, the industry has played a critical role in the rise of many of the digital powers that consume our daily lives, helping to fuel the success of the likes of Uber, YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok.",
            "Despite that prominence, the industry has still been challenged by the accelerating digital disruption, unable to reap the financial rewards to match its economic and technological influence. e& (previously Etisalat Group) is an innovative, forward-thinking operator that is reorienting itself to alter this disparity. Headquartered in the UAE, with 162 million customers across 16 markets in the Middle East and Africa, e& recently embarked on an ambitious journey to transform from a telco into a techco, creating several new, key growth verticals. e& Group CEO, Hatem Dowidar, spoke about the transformation, as well as the future of the industry, the growing importance of ESG, and new ways to attract top talent, with McKinsey senior partner Wajih Abou-Zahr and partner Eefke Post. Their edited conversation appears below.",
            " How do you view the future of the telecom operator industry?",
            " I look at the future of telecommunications with much optimism. As the pandemic showed, we have become so essential to peopleâs lives, practically a utility like electricity and water [became] a century ago. It is something people need and will continue to need in the coming years. At the same time, some of the services that were once core to our business, such as messaging and voice, have already been disrupted by instant messaging or voice over IP (VoIP). That means thereâs only an upside with the additional services we can offer.",
            "We are very excited about our evolution from a telco to a techco. To grow, we need to move from connectivity to selling comprehensive solutions. We believe there is much room to extend our remit in several directions.",
            " What lessons can the industry learn from the last decade to create more success and value in the coming years?",
            " We learned a lot from the recent disruptions our industry has experienced. When VoiP arrived or instant messaging became mainstream, we risked losing too much of our value and significance to recover.",
            "How did we end up in such a vulnerable position? As organizations, we had grown and built our business model, confident that revenue would continue to come from the same places. When we realized that some of these revenues had disappeared, it took us a while to reorient the organization and generate new services.",
            "In all businesses, I think it is crucial to be more paranoid about the potential loss of business and be prepared and agile enough to change the business model.",
            "So now, as we become a technology company, we can identify future opportunities much faster. We are working on many things that will not necessarily provide revenue in the short term. But three to five years from now, these projects will bear fruit and compensate for some of this disruption.",
            " Youâre in the middle of a bold strategy to delayer the traditional business and turn your telco into a techco. What inspired this transformation?",
            " Our delayering and changes to the business model were driven by the fact that we havenât moved fast enough to deal with the near-constant disruption of recent years.",
            "We donât have infinite resources. To execute the shift from a telco to a techco, we need to free up many resources, and what enables this is the evolution of technology. On the customer-facing side, advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics mean there is less need for customers to connect regularly with call centers and service agents. They can now resolve many issues or get answers to questions by themselves. On the back end, virtual networks and cloud-based services help free up specific technical resources to work on more cutting-edge, innovative projects to create future revenue streams.",
            "So, in the end, delayering and reorganizing the departments was essential.",
            " As part of this journey, Etisalat has rebranded into e& and restructured into separate business pillars. Can you explain that restructuring and the value you expect to capture?",
            " We have gone through a restructuring over the past year to deliver on this transformation agenda from a telco to a techco.",
            "We have moved from a more typical telco structure, with one consumer division and one enterprise division sitting underneath top leadership, to a model comprised of distinct business lines.",
            "The first is very simple, our UAE telco, called etisalat by e&. The UAE is our home market and most significant business unit, and the CEO of this business pillar reports directly to me.",
            "Then, we have a separate business pillar (and CEO) for our 15 international telco markets outside the UAE. e& international focuses on two things. One is proper governance, while the other is ensuring that we carry the best practices across the different markets in areas such as commercial, technology, and regulatory frameworks.",
            "We then have e& enterprise, the business pillar focusing on enterprise solutions such as cloud business, cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT), and AI.",
            "Next is e& life, a business pillar focusing on OTT (over-the-top) services to sell directly to customers. The current push is on fintech and content, though we may pursue other areas, such as health and education, in the future.",
            "In our region with so many unbanked people, we want to create a fintech ecosystem that starts with a digital wallet but can also offer a much more comprehensive suite of services.",
            "On content, we believe we have a natural advantage by being in the region and knowing our customers well. This will help us offer the best local and global programming selection, from linear to VOD (video-on-demand) to streaming. With a base of 162 million aggregate Group subscribers, we have a distinct advantage over most OTTs because we have much easier customer acquisition.",
            "Our investment arm is e& capital, which focuses on investing in businesses we donât intend to control and offers two distinct kinds of investments. We have a venture capital (VC) arm, which is looking into opportunities to invest in early-stage companies, and a growth arm, where we are more focused on taking bigger, but still minority, stakes in more established companies.",
            " The operator industry is now thinking about impact in a much more holistic way. How do you see the role of operators in ESG?",
            " I think ESG has become core to what we do. It has become especially relevant in emerging markets, where our social impact as telecoms in the past and as technology providers going forward is significant.",
            "But ESG is no longer just about a philanthropic desire to do good and be a good corporate citizen. It heavily influences the way that investors, customers, and potential hires look at us as well. Many people will only invest now in companies making a genuine effort in ESG, and more and more people and organizations are only buying services from companies they believe are committed to it. Our staff highly value what we do in this area, and many job candidates will only consider working for companies that are serious about ESG.",
            "We are building an ESG structure within the company where people at the most senior levels are engaged in ESG, taking part in active discussion and communication around the issues. I believe we are off to a good start. Our last ESG rating was an A, one of the highest in the region. We aspire to maintain and grow that rating further by putting more effort into ESG.",
            " Telecom operators were historically a magnet for talent. Over the last several years, the sector has ceded much of this appeal to OTTs and other industries. What is your plan for attracting and retaining the best talent?",
            " Talent has always moved from one industry to another. A few decades ago, telcos became very attractive because they seemed new and exciting. And then, as we became more disrupted by technology players, the telco sector appeared less appealing. People wanted to work with companies driving innovation and changing the world, and telcos no longer seemed to fall into that category.",
            "However, as new technologies like 5G have arrived and many telcos (such as ours) are transforming themselves into true techcos, weâre starting to become more attractive to top talent. We are now able to tell prospective candidates, âJoin us, because we are going to lead on AI. We are going to lead on cybersecurity or the metaverse as they will change the world.â",
            "As part of this new approach to talent, we have launched initiatives like our graduate trainee program. Most recently, this was about artificial intelligence and how it can be incorporated into many jobs. So, even if youâre working in finance, how can you do those jobs better with AI? If youâre working on networks, how can you incorporate AI? Even if you are working on procurement, how can you procure better with AI?",
            "This way, the best talent sees us as a company that is not accepting the status quo. And then they will hopefully want to join us on our journey.",
            " When youâre away from work, in your spare time, what kind of content do you gravitate to?",
            " I have very eclectic tastes in music. I like jazz and hard rock, depending on the time of day or my mood. On my way to the office in the morning, I usually listen to hard rock and driving back home in the evening, I generally listen to jazz.",
            "Even when I watch TV, Iâm interested in two different genres. On the one hand, I am fascinated by history and historical fiction, so I watch TV series like ",
            " or ",
            ". On the other hand, I love things that are pure fantasy, like ",
            ", ",
            ", or a Marvel movie. That kind of entertainment allows me to enjoy a classic battle of good versus evil, where most of the time, good wins.",
            " If you hadnât embarked on a career in telecom, what industry could you see yourself working in today?",
            " Another industry that I have always been fascinated by is space. During my childhood, one of the few ways to get into that industry was if you were in government or the military. But the industry has developed of late, whether with telecommunications satellite services or companies offering private orbiting opportunities. I believe there will be actual space travel, with people going to other planets, perhaps not in my lifetime, but certainly in the future. By that point, the industry may be as exciting and ubiquitous as aviation was 40 or 50 years ago or where our industry is today.",

        "paragraphs": [
            " product inclusion and equity began to gain currency in the tech sector, Annie Jean-Baptiste was thinking hard about how to broaden the pool of perspectives that are incorporated into the product design and development process. Her work in diversity, inclusion, and equity (DEI) at Google was primarily centered around internal culture and representation, and she and some colleagues began to discuss taking underrepresented or marginalized users into account when building products for the mass market. Several years later, Jean-Baptiste leads an entire team at Google devoted to that idea. She spoke recently to McKinsey partners Claudy Jules and Martin Harrysson about what it takes to make equity and inclusion a core part of the product process and the benefits that follow. The edited conversation appears below.",
            " What does âproduct inclusion and equityâ mean, and how did you get involved with this work at Google?",
            " At Google, there is a program where we can spend 20 percent of our time doing something that isnât our core role but that weâre super passionate about. Product inclusion and equity started about six years ago as a 20 percent project of mine.",
            "When I reflect on my career and thread the needle backward, it makes sense: I started in the global business org, then joined the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) team, and product inclusion and equity are a mixture of business, product, and DEI. When I was on the DEI team, a few of us noticed that a lot of the focus was internal, on things like culture and representation. We thought there was an opportunity to expand how we talked about diversity, equity, and inclusion as it relates to our products, to encompass the billions of users worldwide who have different races, genders, socioeconomic statuses, and speak different languages. We started to think through what it would look like if we began to ask, âWho else needs to be included in the product development process? Who elseâs perspectives do we needâ? That kicked off a few projects, and now we have a full-fledged team of people across Google working on product inclusion and equity.",
            "At the core of it, product inclusion and equity are about making people feel seen. When they pick up a product or use a service or piece of technology, they feel like they were thought of when it was created. They feel like the different things that make them ",
            " were part of the design and development process. This leads to tech doing what it is intended to do: amplify peopleâs lives and make them richer.",
            " Why do you think product inclusion and equity are gaining so much prominence now?",
            " I think the world has had a reckoning over the past two years, with many candid conversations kicking off. Thereâs been a lot of vulnerability and accountability, frankly, around making sure that people have inclusive and equitable experiences across the board in everything they do.",
            "When product teams start to think about product inclusion and equity, I talk to them about the âcurb cut effect.â The curb cut in sidewalks was originally made in the â70s for wheelchair users, but we all use it now, whether itâs people with skateboards, suitcases, or shopping carts.",
            "The critical thing to understand is that building for a historically marginalized group results in better outcomes for everyone. There are a lot of examples of that throughout history; another is closed captioning. So even though it feels amplified now, decades ofÂ work have helped to ensure that those who have historically not been at the center of development and design can have their voices involved throughout critical points in the process.",
            " How does one know what those key points are for inclusive innovation?",
            " At the core is thinking about who your user could and should be. Itâs not about completely doing away with the target customer or user you had initially focused on, but about widening the pool. I used to have a teammate who said, âIf youâre talking about âthem,â there had better be some âtheysâ in the room.â I think about that all the time.",
            "We all come to the world and move through the world with bias because our brains have to take mental shortcuts. Itâs not about being punitive. Itâs about holding up a mirror and saying, âI donât represent everyone around the world, so how do I get those different perspectives in?â I identify as a Black woman, but I donât represent all Black women. So how do we make sure that 1) weâre not pegging communities as a monolith and 2) weâre getting those potentially historically marginalized perspectives into our product design and development process?",
            "A couple of years ago, we did some research and found that there are four critical inflection points in the design and development process companies should focus on: ideation, user research and design, user testing, and marketing. What I like about those four is that they very cleanly go throughout the design and development processâfrom the ideation, the earliest point, to marketing and launching a product.",
            "Regardless of the industry, most organizations have similar touchpoints. You have to come up with the idea. You have to do some research and prototyping to create a design. You have to validate that prototype with testing, focus groups, or surveys. And then you have to launch it.",
            "So, itâs not about completely reimagining a process. Itâs about being more intentional about the processes you already have, broadening those pools, and asking, âWho else needs to be included in this? Who is most at the margins of this? And how do we ensure those perspectives are included at those critical points throughout the process?â",
            " What are your thoughts on the moral and social responsibility of investing in product inclusion and equity? Is there also a business case for this work?",
            " This is about balancing the human and the business case. Thatâs a bit of a cognitive shift when we talk about diversity, equity, and inclusion, which has historically focused on the moral case (which is really important).",
            "For the business case, Iâve been inspired by a few articles on the ânew ROIâ or ânew return on influence.â",
            " Thereâs a misconception that because historically marginalized groups are underrepresented, they donât have power. And thatâs not true. When you talk about a billion people in the world with a disability or Black and Latinx consumers, they have trillions of dollars in purchasing power. These groups lead cultural trends and zeitgeists, so we want to ensure that their needs, desires, and passions are embedded into our products. That shift, from seeing these groups as underrepresented to having a ton of cultural and economic power, is vital to making the business case.",
            " If another company is looking to do some of the things youâre doing at Google, where would you suggest they start? Are there certain products, sectors, or places where the impact you can have with this work is particularly substantial?",
            " I would start by thinking about where you could begin to bring perspective to those four process points. If youâre doing user research, for example, do you only focus on cities versus rural areas? Do you only do research in the US? With user testing, are you only testing with people who work inside your company?",
            "Those are the small steps you can start to take. At Google, weâve been leaning toward community-based participatory research. That means having the community lead at the outset, in terms of what their goals, needs, and challenges are, versus having them come in and provide perspective later in the process. The earlier you bring in these perspectives, the easier it is, and the lessons will cascade throughout the process.",
            "The other benefit is that youâll learn things that may not even be related to DEI or product inclusion and equity. The more you have differing opinions, the better the outcome and the innovation are for everyone. Research shows that with diverse teams, there may be more friction up front when youâre getting to the solution. But because youâve had so many differing opinions, youâve thought about and worked through almost all the potential pitfalls and challenges. When you launch something after a less inclusive process, you often end up having to scramble and retroactively fix it.",
            " What are some interesting or surprising examples of companies doing something to make their products more inclusive?",
            " Two examples come to mind. One is a company called Eone, which makes a watch that people can use to tell time by touch, not just sight. Whatâs great about that is that the tactile component was originally made for people with disabilities. But there are many other people, those who may learn differently or may not be as visual, who could benefit from having access to that dual-modality.",
            "OXO is another example. The company was originally founded to make kitchen utensils that would be easier to grip for people with severe arthritis or other disabilities, but nowadays, many people consider it their favorite brand.",
            "It goes back to that curb-cut effect. Someone once said, âWhen you build for the margins, you get the center for free.â And I think that thatâs important to remember; when you build for those most excluded, the benefits cascade throughout.",
            " We work with clients across all sectors, and sometimes it can be easy for people to say, âThis is a problem that big tech needs to tackle, but it doesnât apply to my sector.â Would you say that this is a cross-sector issue and that there are things companies can do about it across sectors?",
            " Absolutely. Anytime you create something, whether itâs in fashion, medicine, or finance, youâre coming with your own lived experience. If youâre building something for someone else, you should ask, âWho else needs to be in the room?â Even with B2B, you start to think about your customerâs customer. And that is someone who has a different lived experience.",
            "So, you start to think about âwho elseâ? Who else could benefit from this? Who else might have challenges that we could mitigate? Regardless of where you are or what sector youâre in, thinking about those most unlike the group you have historically been building for is very important.",
            " Many say that what cannot be measured cannot be improved. What are some ways to measure inclusiveness or make it more tangible?",
            " First, this should be measured just like any other critical part of a business. It shouldnât be measured separately. At Google, we use OKRs [objectives and key results], and we have OKRs around product inclusion and equity up to the company level.",
            "The other piece is having metrics that matter. Our team has human-centric metrics around aspects like customer satisfaction, sentiment, and daily active users. Those arenât necessarily different from what people are already measuring. Still, you need to be intentional in thinking about the groups that are most at the margins when looking at that data. Because you donât want to look at general data and say, âOh, customer satisfaction is at 90 percent.â You have to ask, âWhoâs the 10 percent? And how does that skew?â Itâs about looking at the kind of data thatâs important for your business and making sure that youâre looking at those who may be historically underrepresented in that.",
            "Even early on, when youâre starting to assess product-market fit, consider whether you have only gone to the regular group or demographic for feedback. Other groups may have completely different ideas or needs that you may not have otherwise considered.",
            " You mentioned OKRs that can presumably roll up to a senior executive level. Can you share an example of what that might look like?",
            " Our CEO laid out racial equity commitments a few years ago, so we have OKRs around some of our work to empower historically marginalized businesses. Our Black-owned business attribute, which launched a little while back, is an example of this. The question is, how do we start to take our key products and create opportunities for, and ways to empower, these historically marginalized groups?",
            " As others are getting started on this journey, what are some roadblocks or challenges that you hear about? How can companies learn from them or overcome them?",
            " We look at 13 dimensions of diversityâincluding race, gender, age, ability, and socioeconomic statusâand the intersections of those dimensions. Sometimes when people first see that, theyâre overwhelmed: âThirteen different things I have to think about? How am I supposed to prioritize that?â What you want to do is start to think holistically and intersectionally about your user. Thereâs not one thing that makes you you. An example I use with product teams is that Iâm a Black woman whoâs also left-handed. Itâs not like Iâm Black on Monday, left-handed on Tuesday, and a woman on Wednesday. Iâm all those things all the time. It affects how I move through the world. It affects how the world views me. And it definitely affects how I interact with products and services.",
            "At times there may be a more prominent dimension. If Iâm using scissors, obviously, only being left-handed is whatâs important. But if Iâm unlocking my phone with facial recognition or using a phone to take a picture, being Black and a woman will intersect. Thinking about how these multiple dimensions come together and how that affects someoneâs experience is important.",
            " What else can leadership teams do to empower product teams to build more inclusive products?",
            " As with any other kind of initiative, tone at the top is critical. Leaders must find an authentic way to talk about why this is important to them. A former manager of mine would always say, âRepetition doesnât spoil the prayer.â It has to be a steady drumbeat and not a one-off.",
            "Itâs also about empowering everyoneâproduct managers, software engineers, researchers, marketersâto own their piece of the process. With product managers, itâs about empowering them to understand the opportunity, whether it be outside the US or with another demographic. With engineers, itâs about thinking through what infrastructure and tooling can make this easier and more seamless. With marketers, itâs thinking about how to make your companyâs voice more inclusive, whether through ads, having someone with an accent represent your brand, or making sure that people with disabilities are represented in commercials.",
            " Have you seen leaders put in place formal incentives or other mechanisms to commit further to product inclusion and equity?",
            " Recognition is important, as is having inclusion and equity as part of how you evaluate people. I donât think this work should be a standalone or a separate thing. It should be part of your companyâs DNA, and people should be measured accordingly.",
            "The other piece of recognition is that for a lot of this work, at least in the beginning, you may be leaning on employees whose core role is unrelated. At Google, we have what we call âinclusion championsâ: thousands of Googlers from historically marginalized backgrounds who are testing our products and providing feedback all the time. Here, itâs about 1) making sure that this work is genuinely optional and 2) recognizing these people and rewarding them for those lived experiences and perspectives that theyâre bringing to the table. We want to make sure that they are excited to do this and that itâs not an additional job. Recognition is really important on that front.",
            " What could executives from other companies learn from your experience leading product inclusion at Google?",
            " Itâs a journey, and you want to make sure that youâre committed to the long term. But itâs also about knowing that every day is an opportunity to get it right, so you need to be humble and continue pushing forward.",
            "As weâve started to build muscle around what this work looks like, weâre committed to sharing the learnings and welcoming feedback. Weâve launched some guidelines on our site, belonging.google, and Iâd encourage leaders and team members to take a look. It walks you through the different points in the process, lists questions you can ask your teams, and includes our tips and best practices. When you do this work over and over, it becomes just a natural, regular part of how you operate. I hope that resource will be helpful to people as they start their product inclusion and equity journey.",

            ". To shed light on the current evolution of film and TV, she spoke to McKinsey Executive Editor Daniel Eisenberg about the post-pandemic outlook for the moviegoing experience, the excitement of storytelling opportunities in streaming, the role of data in the entertainment business, and the state of diversity and representation in the industry. The edited conversation appears below.",
            " The pandemic has had a major impact on movie theaters, and even before the pandemic the demographics of theatergoers had been changing. Do you see movie theaters regaining their key distribution roles over the rest of the decade?",
            " If you look at the box office success of films like ",
            " or ",
            ", itâs clear that weâre already seeing theaters regain their role in the post-pandemic world. I donât see the road to a billion-dollar franchise without a key theatrical component. But [release] windows are changed forever. Streaming is here to stay ",
            " theatrical is here to stay. And the important thing is going to be for the distributors to grow a younger audience.",
            " Thereâs been a trend of films being released on streaming services at the same time as they open in theaters or within a week or two. Do you think that will be a blip based on the pandemic, or do you see the trend continuing? Is that a sustainable model for the industry?",
            " I think it gives the distributors and the filmmakers a little more optionality. We pretty much know whatâs going to happen by the end of Friday night for a weekend, in terms of the projections. If youâve spent your $50 million on marketing and you realize that itâs not going to work, it would be great to have the option to capitalize on that marketing campaign and make the movie available to a wider audience.",
            "Even within different demographics, people reacted differently during the pandemic. ",
            " was generally for men under 25, and they had no hesitancy about going to the theater. I had a film, ",
            "âthe Aretha Franklin film, starring Jennifer Hudsonâcome out in the middle of the Delta variant. We had to pivot to a âpremium video on demand,â or PVOD, model, as quickly as we possibly could because we were getting so many requests. There were church groups that had bought group sales that then had to cancel because they were frightened. Women over 30 were much more hesitant to go to the theater than any other demographic.",
            "Weâre in a time of flux, in a time of change, and what was on its way towards being broken is being broken in a different way.",
            " How much do you think the moviegoing experience will change over the next decade?",
            " I really hope the moviegoing experience changes over the next decade, because I think itâs important for the health of the industry. Iâm a big believer in theatrical, not just because of my romantic love of cinema (though thatâs a huge part of it). I believe in the process of sitting and spending two hours, uninterrupted and singularly focused, and its impact on us as human beings.",
            "Cinema is an interactive experience. Youâre sitting in the dark with 300 people that you donât know, that arenât like you, and youâre sharing a group experience. The only other thing thatâs like that is theater, and obviously, itâs more intense because itâs live.",
            "But that experience needs to be made more accessible and affordable for young people so that this habit continues to grow. Weâre definitely seeing a graying of the theatrical audience. If youâre a teenager, itâs expensive to go to the movies. And it becomes about a value proposition. Even though the subscription film models didnât work because they were underpriced, I think they got a lot more people under the age of 25 back to the theater.",
            "If it becomes financially accessible and important to kids to be a part of the conversation, people see it. I have an 18-year-old and a 20-year-old, and yes, theyâre my kids so theyâre more interested in filmmaking, but when somethingâs coming out in the theater by Christopher Nolan or Quentin Tarantino, or another filmmaker that they love, they go to see it.",
            "Because of successes like ",
            " and ",
            ", or earlier streaming shows like mine, ",
            ", there are sophisticated audiences out there for television that is quite cinematic and as good as any form of entertainment out there. And itâs also very accessible to young people. So, theyâre going to have a higher bar for what they expect.",
            "I also think itâs important to develop new filmmakers and new voices. Itâs exciting that weâre getting into truly intersectional times where weâre telling different stories because thatâs the next level of innovation. Itâs new voices and new perspectives.",
            " What do you think the moviegoing experience will look like in 2030?",
            " I hope that in 2030, we can kill whatever kind of electronic devices weâre using when you come into the movie theater. I hope that film becomes even more communal, more of a hub, and more of a community, because I think the more we become device-heavy, the more disconnected we become. Storytelling is about generating empathy. And I think thatâs important as we become more sorted into affinity buckets.",
            "I hope that theaters are healthy and robust, and that content is more representative and accessible because as the cost of making films comes down it will be more accessible to a broader range of filmmakers. I donât know if I want to have some kind of digital interface talk back to the screen. I like the old-school way of offering feedback, with people yelling at the screen.",
            "I think the most important thing is for us to continue to renew the business with new voices. As the demand for storytelling accelerates, the âfarm teamâ doesnât exist as much as it used to, and people are being pushed through a lot faster. Continuing to look for underrepresented voices is going to be huge for the business.",
            " How do you see the role of analytics and the relationship between increasingly sophisticated analytics and creativity? Can analytics help reach niche audiences, or do you think they lead to a âlowest common denominatorâ effect?",
            " Data has always been important in the film business, but itâs a guide. People in tech sometimes like to think that everything will yield to data, but storytelling is alchemy. Iâve worked on movies that have tested incredibly well that nobody shows up for. Iâve worked on movies where a third of the audience has walked out of screenings but have gone on to become some of the biggest hits of my career.",
            "Iâm hoping that one of the great innovations is that the cost of marketing comes way, way down because that is a real barrier to the kinds of films that can be made. And analytics help remind people that there are underserved audiences. Teen films used to be hugeâall of the John Hughes movies, and tons of other filmsâand then teen television shows became really big again, with shows like ",
            ", and people stopped making movies for that audience. Well, Netflix certainly saw what a huge void that is. Kidsâ stuff is huge because parents will put their kids in front of anything so that they can multitask.",
            "The question is, how do you use analytics in figuring out how to make things special and how to make things cut through? Data alone could lead to greenlighting a lot of mediocre content thatâs forgettable. Then you have a library that doesnât contain things that people are going to watch over and over again, like ",
            " or ",
            " or ",
            ", which stand the test of time.",
            " Youâve talked about studios being forced to try to act more like tech companies to compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon. How does that impact what kinds of things can get made and the output going forward, from a creative standpoint?",
            " It actually becomes more important than ever to cut through. Like in music, youâre no longer competing with what comes out that weekend. Youâre competing with the history of film and entertainment. So how do you cut through when there are so many choices?",
            "HBO Max did an incredible job last summer, and itâs based on the quality. ",
            " came out of nowhere, and everybody was talking about it, and then they had ",
            ". They went on a great run. Apple has its first massively talked-about hit in ",
            ", which just continued to build organically. Netflix definitely has a âmore is moreâ approach, and then ",

            " and ",
            ", itâs going to be interesting to watch how much the new stuff feels disposable or like things that youâre going to continue to come back to.",
            "The film business, like the music business, is notoriously slow, to quote Wayne Gretzky, âto skate to where the puck is going.â There should have been no reason why the record labels didnât come up with Spotify or iTunes first, but they were trying to squeeze every dime out of CDs. Their business was broken apart. And the film business, instead of looking to make up DVD revenues by selling to Netflix, could have created Netflix. Thatâs a never-ending cycle in film and television, which potentially is changing.",
            " How is the shift to streaming impacting you as a filmmaker? Is it a more appealing proposition, being able to produce quality creative output, that you donât have to limit yourself to a single two-hour movie and can create a series of episodes instead?",
            " Whatâs exciting right now in storytelling is that we have the opportunity to tell a story in whatever format fits it best, with no real stigma. When I first started out, TV had a certain connotation to it. Thatâs why HBOâs original motto was âItâs not TV. Itâs HBO.â",
            "Iâve been working on the adaptation of ",
            " for over 10 years. It couldnât be contained in two hours, which is why finally itâs going to go forward as a limited series. So thatâs really exciting.",
            "You can now get the cast you want. You can get the filmmaking talent you want. Everyoneâs excited about telling stories. Whether youâre telling stories in something thatâs serialized and is 12 minutes, whether youâre telling a story in a limited series of nine episodes, like we did in Mrs. America, or youâre telling a story in a two-and-a-half-hour film, I still believe that people will come out.",
            "The great thing about storytelling right now is that itâs very democratic. Whether youâre going to be telling a story on television or in a streaming movie or in the theater, thereâs no thumbed nose. If youâre a new filmmaker, like Barry Jenkins, you can make a masterpiece like ",
            ", and then make a masterpiece like ",

            " I believe that it was always hard to get mid-range movies made. It was hard to get ",
            " made in 2000. If we didnât have the biggest movie star in the world, Julia Roberts, we never would have gotten that film made. But the trajectory of my career has followed that most of the films that weâve made have not necessarily been that easy to get made.",
            "We fought long and hard to get $8.5 million to make ",
            ". In hindsight it all makes sense, but unless youâre looking at a very specific IP, thereâs always an alchemical combination of budget, star, and filmmaker to get greenlit.",
            "Streaming has been fantastic for indie films and filmmakers. Iâm sure more people got to see ",
            " than they would have had it just had a traditional release. It used to be that when a small film won an Oscar, it had a huge impact on the level of exposure and the level of release. Thatâs all changed a lot.",
            " What advice do you have for aspiring filmmakers?",
            " There are a lot of ways to tell your stories, but the most important thing is to know what you want to say, what your unique lens is. If you look at someone like Rian Johnson, yes, of course, he went and made a ",

With strategies and partnerships aimed at the convergence of the IoT and cybersecurity, industry and consumers alike can realize the remarkable possibilities that lie ahead.",
            "A question commonly asked by technology leaders across the globe: What are the key factors inhibiting wide-scale IoT adoption today? Driven by our hypothesis that the convergence of the IoT and cybersecurity can unlock a massive amount of new value, we explored the IoT landscape to understand better the obstacles to broad IoT adoption and how they might be overcome.",
            "Across industry verticals, applications of the IoT continue to expand, and a shift has occurred from clusters of siloed IoT devices to interconnected IoT environments. This is especially apparent in settings such as factory floors and automotive vehicles. However, the IoT hasnât yet scaled as quickly as expected, and the IoT industry hasnât achieved a genuinely seamless experience in which devices pass into and out of physical environments and are identified, trusted, and managed without a need for separate (and at times manual) authentication steps.",
            "The proliferation of connected devices, along with the advancement of the complexity in IoT use cases (such as autonomous systems and transportation), creates opportunities for multiple players of the value chain. But it also creates the risk of vulnerabilities that could have catastrophic consequences. The risk profiles of many IoT systems are elevated compared with that of enterprise IT, given the IoTâs control over physical operations. A seamless IoT experience, therefore, requires a foundation in digital trust, functional convergence of the IoT and cybersecurity, and an early-stage integration of cybersecurity in the architecture design and pilot phase.",
            "Traditional approaches to security in the IoT donât support this secure, seamless experience. IoT buyers report that there is little multilayered security embedded in todayâs IoT solution designs. This leads to vulnerabilities that in turn require regular over-the-air updates and patches, which canât be reliably implemented. Relative to enterprise IT, solution design in the IoT space lags behind in security assurance, testing, and verification.",
            "We tested our hypothesis around the importance of cybersecurity and IoT convergence with industry leaders and uncovered another important finding. There is a wide mindset gap between IoT buyers and providers regarding expected IoT adoption, digital privacy, and trust concerns, and the delay caused by siloed decision-making leads. Knowing some of these facts should help future technology leaders on both the buyer and provider sides understand the othersâ mindsets and move toward unlocking the value.",

They are encountering hurdles even during the early stages of IoT implementation. Their main concerns are around interoperability, cybersecurity, and installation complexities.",
            "IoT solution providers heavily underestimate the importance of digital trust in comparison with buyers; only about 30 percent of providers consider digital trust to be critical in IoT solutions, compared with approximately 60 percent of buyers who view it as such. But IoT buyers need more cohesive decision-making structures to address their cybersecurity concerns. Most providers blame siloed decision making between the IoT and cybersecurity groups on the buyer end for delays in IoT adoptionâ81 percent of providers hold that perspective. Conversely, only 42 percent of buyers believe the decisions are siloed.",
            "From these insights, we conclude that it will take a significant shift in the philosophy of IoT solution design, along with a holistic convergence of IoT and cybersecurity functionalities, to build user confidence in the IoT, speed up its adoption, and drive new value across its verticalsâthus creating a fully interconnected IoT environment. These market forces are further supported by increased policy making  at both the public and private levels. Technology leaders who grasp the required mindset will be able to influence disruptive change for both consumer and enterprise applications.",
            "When the industry can converge the IoT and cybersecurity, the reward could be enormous. By 2030, the IoT suppliersâ market is expected to reach approximately $500 billion in a baseline scenario. In a scenario in which cybersecurity concern is completely managed, executives would increase spend on the IoT by an average of 20 to 40 percent. Moreover, an additional five to ten percentage points of value for IoT suppliers could be unlocked from new and emerging use cases. This implies that the combined total addressable market (TAM) value across industries for IoT suppliers could reach in the range of $625 billion to $750 billion.",

In the McKinsey B2B IoT Survey, more than 90 percent of surveyed IoT solution suppliers and buyers cite at least one of those issues as a key reason for decelerating IoT adoption.  Interoperability and cybersecurity occupied the top two spots. Interoperability is an essential ingredient, given the need for multiple interconnected systems; common standards across the IoT value chain would bolster it.

Most participants in the space have tended to treat cybersecurity as a separate software category, providing bolt-on solutions rather than making it a core, integral part of the IoT design process.

Six key outcomes enable a secure IoT environment: data privacy and access under confidentiality, reliability and compliance under integrity, and uptime and resilience under availability (see sidebar âExpanding the cyber-risk framework for the IoTâ).",
            "Although a baseline cybersecurity functionality is inherent to all IoT industrial verticals and use cases (such as avoidance of unauthorized access), the specific cybersecurity risks that each industry is addressing may vary by use case. For example, cybersecurity in remote patient monitoring in healthcare needs to prioritize confidentiality and availability, while the most important cybersecurity outcome in autonomous vehicles is availability, as operational disruptions could lead to safety hazards. Contactless payments for financial services depend heavily on data integrity.",

If cybersecurity risk were adequately managed, executives would spend an average of 20 to 40 percent more, amounting to $100 billion to $200 billion, in aggregate, on the IoT. Heightened levels of cybersecurity not only result in increased TAM for existing use cases but also create an environment for new and emerging use cases to thrive. As a result, there would be an estimated five to ten percentage points of additional value for IoT suppliers, equating to $25 billion to $50 billion.

Each IoT provider only has control over the protection of its systems and doesnât play a role in the integration of its system with those from other providers.",
            "As a result, IoT buyers take on the enormous responsibility of protecting the IoT value chain. They typically do so by partnering with cybersecurity vendors to provide add-on solutions. These tend to be enterprise-wide cybersecurity solutions rather than IoT-specific products, with additional security features bolted on later as needed.",

            "These disconnects contribute to the problems that IoT providers have in designing the systems that buyers need; likewise, they account for skepticism on adoption speed. Providersâ lower rankings of digital trust and privacy than buyersâ could stem from providers not sufficiently engaging with cybersecurity decision makers (such as chief information officers and chief information security officers). Thus, they have limited visibility on the need for additional trust, privacy, and security; moreover, they are uncertain how those elements will be paid for.",
            "At most IoT buyers, there are different decision makers for IoT and cybersecurity procurement (such as chief technology officer, chief information officer, and chief information security officer). Across these organizations, more executives and managers are involved in IoT procurement than in cybersecurity procurement. Additionally, 14 percent of respondents note that while business-unit heads are directly involved in IoT procurement, they have minimum involvement in cybersecurity decision making. This suggests that cybersecurity solutions have yet to be customized at the product level, let alone in an end-to-end manner that factors security into the full scope of the data architecture of the IoT use cases. With better visibility, chief information and information security officers can make better cybersecurity control decisions.",
            "A more comprehensive approach, with IoT buyers and providers along the product value chain implementing cybersecurity by regulatory compliance, is optimal, as governments have been pushing for more holistic regulations to manage risks (such as International Organization for Standardization [ISO] rule ISO 21434 and the guidelines from the UN Economic Commission for Europe World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations in the automotive industry). In todayâs new use cases, buyers and providers rely on âhandshake agreementsâ in which no clear delineation of cyberattack responsibilities exists. These agreements often result in players extending their IT cybersecurity to IoT applications through functionality add-ons. Increased IoT adoption and emerging cyberthreats will require rigorous regulatory compliance models to prevent any breaches.",
            "Most IoT systems today are designed for one-way data flowâfrom monitoring of sensors to data analysisâcontrolled by humans. As IoT cybersecurity transitions to a holistic, system-level approach that addresses the CIA framework, it can enable a change from systems that require operator input for data collection and data monitoring to IoT systems that need no human interface. This would mean a shift in how IoT solutions are designed and implemented. In the future, the industry could move to models in which IoT solutions are designed to operate on the basis of holistic self-trust. It would mark the convergence of cybersecurity and the IoT.",

These would reduce complexity in the IoT buyerâcybersecurity portfolio while making IoT buyers less prone to vulnerabilities across the IoT stack. IoT providers, in turn, would benefit from buyers having less concern around cybersecurity risk.",
            "Cross-functional or cross-technological IoT and cybersecurity integration is emerging, partially driven by buyersâ demand for a holistic and seamless IoT experience. Close to ",
            " of buyers are reducing the number of cybersecurity solutions deployed in their organizations, driven by the desire to reduce procurement complexity. Another major reason for the emergence is that cloud migration presents a unique opportunity for enterprises to design more robust cybersecurity tooling.",
            "Practically, IoTâcybersecurity convergence and better solution designs can make identity and authentication a more seamless experience while adding the capability to block instead of only detect cyberattacks and cyber intrusions. A trust-based model would establish networks and devices in which interoperability standards would be defined to support much greater functionality. Imagine the ability to drop a new device into a network and have it immediately scanned, welcomed, and assigned a trust score. At the highest level, it could immediately start to operate, using data collected by other devices in that network. Examples are drones that leverage data from vehicles in a city and a building security system thatâs informed by nearby emergency services to move into lockdown.",
            "This new approach to cybersecurity would also provide the trust required to enable particular IoT use cases that involve personal, financial, and otherwise sensitive data, such as those that depend on credible transactions. Examples of the use cases benefiting from the approach are machine-to-machine car payments, touchless security enabled by camera recognition within the office, and real-time traffic management.",
            "A cleansheet cybersecurity design would help enable the convergence, serving as an early-stage integration of cybersecurity into IoT systems, starting at the design of the IoT system and remaining operational from the pilot phase onward. This would greatly enhance the security of IoT systems. Today many OEMs fail to secure their systems and network completely in mass-production stages if the embedded security software isnât deployed early during development. As IoT functions shift beyond the monitoring of use cases to autonomous control with less and less human interface, cybersecurity would also need to pivot from detect only to detect and block.",
            "Many pain points need to be solved to achieve such a goal. First, substantial customization will be needed to integrate cybersecurity into legacy IoT infrastructure by industry or use case. This challenge is compounded by the lack of industry talent and support to take on this work. Additional integration challenges come from the high volume of suppliers and the complexity of the ecosystem (in which most systems arenât compatible). Currently, there are multiple network connectivity standards, which also makes seamless experience harder to achieve. At the product level, there is the constant dilemma between achieving high performance and meeting strong cybersecurity requirements on smart devices that have limited computing capacity. This is all happening in conjunction with the growing urgency to solidify user confidence in digital trust and privacy.",
            " can be driven by three types of providers: IoT providers, cybersecurity providers, and platform providers.   Convergence, in this case, is the combination of any technical, functional, or commercial element of the IoT with cybersecurity to form a new, integrated whole.",
            "IoT providers (such as Bosch.IO, Koninklijke Philips, and Medtronic) can integrate more cybersecurity into their IoT products. With their knowledge of the data architecture, they could safeguard the end-to-end security of the IoT stack. Cybersecurity providers (such as Dragos and Palo Alto Networks) are best positioned to provide insights on holistic cybersecurity protection across the IoT value chain. Platform providers, which include cloud service providers and communications companies (such as Amazon Web Services, C3.ai, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, and Verizon), can position themselves as neutral integrators of IoT systems. A few companies (such as BlackBerry and Siemens ) sit at the intersection of cybersecurity and the IoT and are positioned to marry enterprise cybersecurity solutions with IoT platforms.",
            "The IoT market is trending toward convergence, but it isnât likely that this will result in a one-size-fits-all solution. These products may still need to be tailored to vertical- and use-case-specific needs.",
            "There is a strong realization that the IoT market needs to move from bolt-on to integrated cybersecurity solutions, resulting in multiple forms of convergence. In the current ecosystem, multiple players across the tech stack are already crossing territory between the IoT and cybersecurity (see sidebar âThe IoT tech stack and cybersecurity solutionsâ). For instance, device and IoT solution providers are providing cybersecurity solutions for their IoT platforms through routine patch updates to remove vulnerabilities, and enterprise cybersecurity providers have developed IoT management and analytic platforms to complement their offerings.",
            "Approximately 80 percent of surveyed IoT providers are embedding security in some form into their IoT products, and roughly 70 percent of cybersecurity providers are making IoT-specific products, indicating early signs of convergence. Notably, however, only 50 percent of providers are building more holistic solutions for ",
            " cybersecurity ",
            " the IoT, as itâs hard to create a one-size-fits-all solution for cybersecurity needs across different verticals and use cases. Specialized companies will continue to play a role in IoT and cybersecurity operations because of their differing functionality, their heterogenous operating systems, and the lack of standard interfaces and criteria across regions, industries, and requirements. Approximately 60 percent of providers are partnering with other companies to offer comprehensive IoT and cybersecurity solutions rather than building those capabilities in house.",
            "To examine some examples of convergence of the IoT and cybersecurity, we can consider applications in the automotive, healthcare, and smart city contexts. Automotive IoT adoption is growing, with an estimated $100 billion 2030 market for IoT providers, and supported by future trends in the autonomous, connected, electric, and shared mobility space. Use cases range from in-car services such as autonomous driving to shared mobility. Likewise, in healthcare, IoT adoption is growing, with widescale deployment anticipated in three to five years and a projected 2030 provider market of $70 billion. Use cases include clinical applications such as robot-assisted surgery and consumer applications such as improving wellness. Smart cities, still at an early stage of IoT adoption, are headed to an estimated $30 billion IoT provider market by 2030 as adoption ramps up in public services, safety, and transportation.",
            "Cybersecurity risk is at the forefront across industry verticals, so further expansion of solutions and innovation is needed to secure various outcomes in the key CIA framework. Vehicles are becoming âmoving computers on wheelsâ that pose an exponentially higher challenge in cybersecurity availability, particularly in security resilience and system uptime to prevent collisions. In use cases such as autonomous driving, extremely high safety and security requirements are crucial. The healthcare space presents critical risk, both in patient privacy and data-driven care decisions; in fact, survey respondents rank it highest for cybersecurity impact among all verticals. As such, confidentiality and availability are the focus. For smart cities, the primary concern is data integrity, as the security solutions involve multiple stakeholders and cross-cutting natures. Implementing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy is complicated by the lack of standardization in protocols and a gap in cybersecurity talent at city governments.",
            "IoTâcybersecurity convergence has the potential to ease such pain points. In the automotive sector, there is currently a lack of consensus among internal stakeholders on balancing performance with security. This is compounded by complicated integration and interoperability, beckoning a move to a software-defined, domain-based architecture. Healthcare is experiencing limited visibility and control of IoT devices, which also tend to have low computing capacity for security software. These challenges are all complicated by varying cybersecurity standards in network protocols. Smart cities have strong interdependence upon a range of verticals, necessitating significant coordination, which runs up against market segmentation across city networks and use cases.",
            "While the specifics of IoT and cybersecurity convergence differ for each industry, there are common elements. For the automotive space, it means cybersecurity built in at the component level and rigorously tested from initial boot to system interaction. Architectural-level cybersecurity will also be critical in the healthcare sector, with an increasing tendency toward embedded endpoint security.",
            "Additionally, partnerships are also an important element of convergence across verticals. For example, automotive OEMs will partner with security providers and tier-one and -two suppliers to develop standards and establish clear lines of security responsibility. Convergence in smart cities will involve partnerships across verticals and government agencies to meet governmentsâ data reliability standards. Most city use cases are dependent upon other verticals (such as utilities), so convergence in any one of them could lead to convergence for cities.",
            "The IoT is at a crossroads: provide incremental value in siloed clusters or unlock sizable value as an interconnected environment. When the IoT can make the transition to an integrated network within and across industrial verticals, it can provide a fully seamless industrial and consumer experience.",
            "Cybersecurity is a key enabler, providing the trust to integrate IoT networks. As the IoT has exacerbated cybersecurity risk, ranging from digital to physical security, the convergence of IoT and cybersecurity solutions could accelerate adoption of the IoT. However, there are many challenges, including buyersâ high expectations for privacy and digital trust, siloed decision making for the IoT and cybersecurity, and the lack of industry-specific architectural security solutions at the design stage. If security risks are comprehensively managed, an additional $125 billion to $250 billion in IoT value captured by IoT suppliers could be unlocked, implying a $625 billion to $750 billion TAM value in 2030.",
            "IoT and cybersecurity convergence should address IoT buyersâ concerns around digital trust and privacy, enable new use cases, and amplify adoption of existing ones. It will likely allow the IoT industry to adopt higher security standards, driven by government mandates. Convergence will be tailored for vertical needs rather than offer a one-size-fits-all solution, and it will span the entire tech stack rather than be a simple fix that applies only to a portion of the ecosystem.",
            "A shared cybersecurity responsibility model will require strategic partnerships among IoT buyers, providers, and platform players. This presents an opportunity for providers of integrated solutions to consolidate todayâs fragmented IoT and cybersecurity provider ecosystem. Still, this wonât be a winner-takes-all market environment. To maximize the opportunity for the IoT to play an increased role in many aspects of peopleâs lives, numerous players will have to work together to reduce risk, and numerous players will be in a position to reap the rewards.",

        "title": "Fiber opportunity: Four deal types for investors to consider",
        "description": "High investor demand has put a premium on fiber networks that deliver broadband connections to households, but there is still scope for more value-creating deals.",
        "paragraphs": [
            " as a high-risk asset class. Yet as fiber technology has proved its worth over the past decade, so these assets have grown to become some of the most popular among private equity and institutional investors seeking the stable, long-term cash flows that infrastructure can offer. In 2021, 94 deals were made for fiber assets, approximately 80 percent of which (75 deals) were for fiber-to-the-x (FTTX) networksâthe term used to describe a range of network architectures that primarily connect households to broadband services.",
            " Thirty-six of those deals disclosed the amount paid, which totaled $33 billion. That compares with 84 deals the previous year, with about $30 billion paid for 29 of them (Exhibit 1).",
            "Deals have become increasingly expensive due to their popularity, however. Between 2018 and 2021, earnings multiples averaged 16.8, compared with 19.7 in 2021.",
            " Multiples at these levels can make the business case hard to prove in certain markets, where subscriptions would have to exceed those witnessed to date. When it comes to greenfield rollouts, for example, McKinsey analysis suggests that in some markets, 80 percent of all households would be required to subscribe to the providerâs network to achieve an internal rate of return above 10 percent over 25 years.",
            "Higher interest rates and hence increased cost of capital, along with the fact that many of the fiber assets that are most attractive to investors have already been sold, raise still additional considerations for would-be investors, making it reasonable to ask whether the fiber popularity tide could be about to turn. In the first nine months of 2022, deal activity was down slightly (46 deals compared with 49 in the first nine months of 2021), while the overall value of those deals dropped by as much as 21 percent (Exhibit 2). Yet average multiples crept higher still, reaching 22.5 in the period.",
            "These numbers are highly influenced by the mix of deals. Earnings multiples have typically been in the range of 25 to 33 for wholesale fiber companies such as Open Fiber Italy, Orange Concessions France, and Uniti Australia, but lower for smaller, regional companies that have retail arms, such as TalkTalk in the United Kingdom and Vocus in New Zealand. Notwithstanding, our own research and experience suggest there remains scope for many more value-creating deals.",
            "To begin with, there is strong underlying growth in the sector. Data traffic is expected to expand by around 20 percent annually in the next five years,",
            " and fiber is arguably the only fixed-broadband technology currently capable of delivering the speed and capacity expected by governments, businesses, and consumers.",
            "Fiber companies also offer steady EBITDA marginsâtypically above 40 to 50 percent for those providing broadband to consumers, and as high as 70 percent for those that offer wholesale services. But perhaps the biggest consideration is that millions of households still do not have a fiber connection. That represents a huge capital deployment opportunity.",
            " vary widely depending on the target market (exhibit). The competitive dynamics, regulation, and capital expenditure needs will vary in different local markets in any given country, depending largely on the extent of the fiber built. Markets typically fall into one of three broad categories:",
            " Capital spending requirements in these markets are still significant, accounting for $253 billion, or 60 percent of total fiber spending envisaged in coming years to connect households. Emerging markets in Asia, Africa, and South America, where less than 30 percent of households have access to fiber, are considered greenfield, as are a few Western ones, such as Germany, Greece, and Belgium. Here, extensive legacy networks and regulatory frameworks have hindered fiber build-out.",
            " These markets have significant fiber coverage. Between 30 and 60 percent of households have access to fiber provided by one or more large players. Investments to the tune of some $131 billion are required to connect the remainder. Several European markets fall into this category, including the United Kingdom and Austria, as does the United States.",
            " More than 60 percent of households have access to fiber in these markets, which means the opportunity for investment lies in connecting households in rural areas and converting those still using hybrid fiber-coaxial networksâan opportunity worth some $39 billion. Separating assets is also an opportunity in mature markets.",
            "Our analysis of 87 countries suggests that while some â¬900 billion has already been spent laying FTTX networks, at least another â¬400 billion is needed to connect all households in those same countries.",
            " Household access to fiber services is, of course, higher in some countries than others and can be broadly divided into three groupsâgreenfield, acceleration, and mature markets (see sidebar, âFiber technology is universal; fiber markets are localâ). Yet opportunities also lie in FTTX deals that create more value from fiber already laid.",
            "For private infrastructure investors that are considering the sector, some opportunities remain to buy fiber companies outright, but this is not the only way to acquire assets. Weâve examined four different types of deals also worth assessment. Each is attractive for different reasons, is suitable in different markets, depends upon different factors for success, and faces different challenges. We have seen these deal types create value in markets where other types of deals may be prohibitively expensive.",
            "Four deal strategies merit consideration: partnerships with incumbents or new fiber players, the acquisition of challenged fiber players, the consolidation of smaller players, and the acquisition of an incumbent with a view to separating out the fiber assets.",
            "Recent examples of these kinds of deals include TelefÃ³nicaâs partnerships with investment company CDPQ in Brazil to form FiBrasil. Launched in July 2021, FiBrasil rolled fiber out to 500,000 households in the course of six months and plans to reach another 5.5 million homes and businesses within four years.",
            " In Colombia, also in 2021, TelefÃ³nica joined forces with KKR to form ON*NET Fibra, aiming to connect 4.3 million premises in 90 cities over three years. In October 2022, it announced it had already connected two million homes.",
            "There have been few deals of this nature to date. However, just as they once featured in the cable and fixed telecom sectors, so they are likely to grow in number as the fiber market matures.",
            "Examples of this type of deal include the acquisition and merger of Germanyâs Inexio and Deutsche Glasfaser by private equity firms EQT and Omers.",
            " EQT has also bought and merged multiple fiber companies in the Netherlands,",
            " and FiberCop, owned by TIM, KKR, and Fastweb, has done the same in Italy.",
            "The separation of TelefÃ³nica O2 in the Czech Republic into O2 and CETIN is a key example. The combined market capitalization of the separated companies more than doubled in five years.",
            " Other separations are under way or being considered, such as those by TDC in Denmark,",
            " SÃ­minn in Iceland,",
            " and Telecom Italia.",
            "The success of many of these deal types will depend on getting some basics right. Investors will need a thorough understanding of the local market context, particularly when laying new fiber. In one market, for example, the collapse of a major construction company exacerbated a labor shortage, making it hard to deploy capital quickly. In other markets, consumers and businesses have proven slow to switch to fiber, still not yet embracing the use-cases that fiber enables such as high-quality video or fast-paced gaming, seemingly satisfied with digital subscriber and hybrid fiber-coaxial lines.",
            "No matter the deal type, investors will also need a value creation playbook that goes beyond efficiency in capital deployment if they are to meet their internal rate of return objectives. The ability to combine new assets with those already ownedâa customer base or legacy network, for exampleâor experience separating assets could prove important, as could the ability to lower operational and maintenance costs and drive fiber uptake with commercial excellence.",
            "In addition, all investors should maximize the value of the infrastructure by looking beyond household connections. There are opportunities in fiber-to-the-office or fiber-to-the-business, metro fiber networks, backhaul for mobile, and edge computing, for example.",
            "There are risks too, of course. Companiesâ rush to build fiber and regulatorsâ efforts to promote competition by encouraging multiple fiber networks could result in overcapacity and overlapping networks. And while fiber might be todayâs fixed-broadband technology winner, future competition from new technologies cannot be ruled out. In some mature markets in the United States and Europe, where cable penetration is high, Docsis 4.0 is potentially a cheaper way to upgrade the network, even though more upgrades might be required to keep pace with fiberâs expected future performance. ",
            "Â have also met with some success, as has 5G fixed wireless access (FWA) in areas with limited fiber. In India, Reliance Jio recently announced plans to reach 100 million households through 5G FWAâdeployment at a scale that could significantly change the technologyâs economics.",
            " Still other technologies may yet materialize. But the magnitude of the opportunity in fiber markets is one that merits exploration around the globe, tailoring strategies to local market conditions to capture maximum value.",

Before then, the industry had been growing so fast for over a decade that executives and investors tended not to view individual product margins as an overriding concern. Now, however, that has all changed.",

            "After years of rapid growth, the industry faces economic uncertainty, increased capital costs as interest rates rise, and a still-competitive talent market with accelerating wage growth. In the last year alone, 84 percent of publicly listed software companies saw their valuations drop, and more than a quarter experienced a decline of more than 50 percent.",
            "The message from the market is clear: top-line growth alone is not enough. Investors are increasingly pivoting from valuing growth at all costs to focusing instead on efficient growth. In this new era, the software companies that thrive will be those that grow revenue and margin simultaneously.",
            "Given these conditions, the leaders of software companies increasingly push pricing to the top of their agendas, viewing it as a critical lever to grow efficiently and capture value.",
            " how software executives and decision makers are thinking about evolving their pricing functions, we surveyed 184 software executives and decision makers across company sizes: small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), with $50 million to $200 million in annual revenue (29 percent of the total sample); midmarket, with $200 million to $1 billion in annual revenue (27 percent); and enterprise-level companies, with more than $1 billion in annual revenue and in at least five geographies (43 percent).",
            "These executives represent both software pure-play (51 percent) and software-hardware hybrid (49 percent) providers. Their companiesâ products are applications (51 percent), application development and deployment (35 percent), and infrastructure software (14 percent). And they are based in regions around the world: North America (79 percent), AsiaâPacific (10 percent), Western Europe (6 percent), Latin America (4 percent), and the Middle East (1 percent).",
            "We further divided respondents into lower-growth (0 to 30 percent) and higher-growth (greater than 30 percent) groups based on their self-reported year-over-year revenue growth rates; 63 percent of SMEs were higher-growth, compared with 48 percent of midmarket and 36 percent of enterprise-level companies. We looked for significant correlation of certain pricing-related decisions and actions with company growth rates, and we assessed whether readiness and maturity of companiesâ pricing infrastructure also correlates with growth. Through our analysis, we found that these patterns generally hold across company sizes.",
            "To understand what specific actions software companies can take to get the most out of pricing, we surveyed 184 software companiesâ decision makers to learn how executives are thinking about their pricing strategy.",
            " We also looked at how outperforming software companies within this group have differentiated their pricing strategies. This analysis uncovered a set of pricing practices that correlate highly with growth rates (see sidebar, âAbout our researchâ).",
            "Respondents at most of the software companies in our survey (85 percent) indicate that they plan to drive value through price adjustments over the next two years but lack the infrastructure to capture the long-term benefits of pricing and sustain its impact. Worse, many companies also lack the tools and capabilities needed to build this foundational infrastructure. Respondents at about three-quarters of the software companies we surveyed say they lack a dedicated and centralized division to oversee pricing decisions and guidance, relying instead on ad hoc approaches.",
            "Yet almost all our survey respondents say they plan to alter their pricing in the near term. Roughly half say they expect to increase renewal prices and tighten discounting, while just under 40 percent say they plan to increase list prices and drive higher contractual increases at renewal time. Another 12 percent say they expect to reduce prices to disrupt the market. Only 6 percent say they plan to maintain business as usual.",
            "How can companies achieve these kinds of aspirations? To help answer that question, we examined the various pricing actions taken by our survey pool of companies and identified five core approaches that are used more at higher-performing companies and, based on our own experience, generally help produce stronger profits and growth.",
            "The case for investing in pricing functions has never been more straightforward. In fact, our research has shown that a long-term pricing advantage can account for 15 to 25 percent of a companyâs total profits. Investment in the pricing function can take many forms, including head count, training, and organizational systems to enhance pricing accuracy and agility.",
            "Despite the apparent advantages, software companies are generally underinvesting in pricing functions. Only about 49 percent of software executives say they increased investments in their pricing functions in the past year, and even fewer (12 percent) have established a pricing capability-building team to model and spread optimal pricing approaches across the entire organization, especially to frontline sellers.",
            "Nonetheless, investment in pricing functions is quickly accelerating, and higher-growth companies are dedicating more head count to developing their pricing functions. Higher-growth companies are 1.4 times more likely than companies with lower growth rates to devote more than ten full-time employees to product and strategic pricing.",
            "The higher-growth software companies we surveyed also have at the core of their pricing infrastructure a specialized organization that can provide accountability to and ownership of critical pricing decisions. This kind of pricing âcontrol towerâ can serve as a mechanism to enforce deliberate and consistent processes around pricing decisions, manage risk, and provide pricing guidance to frontline sellers.",
            "Hiring alone, of course, is not enough. From our broader work with companies that sell to large enterprises, we know the advantage of training sales employees to make pricing decisions that are beneficial in the long run, instead of the more common practice of making concessions to try to close deals as soon as possible. Such concessions often include signing multiyear contracts with capped annual price increasesâsometimes even no annual increases or ad hoc discounts. Our survey found that pricing guidance and enablement for the front line is seriously lacking. More than half (57 percent) of respondents say their companies lack adequate sales training in negotiation to communicate and support price changes, and 42 percent say their company provides no deal-level pricing guidance, a shortcoming that may allow an unnecessary loss of value.",
            "Providing this level of guidance relies on access to insights, which in turn requires investment in pricing analytics capabilities. Reluctance to invest in these aspects of the pricing function can impose a high cost. For example, despite the preponderance of multiyear contracts in the B2B space, our research shows how surprisingly common it is for companies to lose value from existing customers on contracts that lack mechanisms for annual price hikes. Over 85 percent of respondents indicate that their companies had a contract annualized price increase that fell below the United Statesâ year-on-year inflation rate in 2022. Setting minimum price increase thresholds for renewals can safeguard margins, yet only about a third of respondents say their companies have incorporated such pricing guidance into their renewal infrastructure.",
            "Recently, a global IT services provider achieved an approximately 5 percent increase on earnings before interest and taxes by setting up a pricing negotiation recipe and library of documents and reference materials to help frontline sellers conduct negotiations with key accounts. Sellers had been given a pricing target but were unsure how to broach the conversation with clients outside of the renewal cycle, so the company armed them with content and tools. These include a fact base to illustrate how price adjustmentsâor the lack thereofâhave been out of step with inflation and their clientsâ own price adjustments. Other content consists of talking points for responding to potential clientsâ objections. In addition, capability training programs were tweaked to align with how adults learn; the new design includes short, optional, and interactive sessions with role playing, rather than compulsory full-day sessions packed with theoretical information. The new format commands better attendance, as sellers spread the word and encourage others to attend.",
            "In another example, a large enterprise software player with a massive installed base was struggling to monetize renewals pricing, especially in the current high-inflation, high-uncertainty environment. To address this issue, the company set up a pricing control tower with resources including deal desk support, analytics, strategic pricing, marketing, legal, IT, and customer success. The price control tower drove an incremental 3 percent price adjustment by ensuring focus on four key elements:",
            "An option software companies can consider for differentiating their pricing strategies is to employ sophisticated, data-driven approaches that align pricing options more closely to customer preferences. Higher-growth companies lead the pack in pricing analytics capabilities: they are 1.7 times more likely than lower-growth organizations to integrate advanced analytics into their provision of pricing guidance to frontline sellers.",
            "Most companies, though, have taken a more cautious approach to investments in pricing analytics capabilities. Many software companies we surveyed havenât yet embraced core analytics tools (Exhibit 1). Only about a quarter of respondents say they have tools to provide descriptive analytics (the ability to report pricing performance and results), and almost as many have diagnostic analytics (the ability to diagnose underlying reasons for pricing results and trends). And fully 15 percent of respondents say their companies have no pricing analytics capability whatsoever.",
            "Companies that lack the new advanced analytics tools emerging for pricing use cases are missing out on capabilities to forecast pricing results (predictive), anticipate customersâ unique needs and behaviors (prescriptive), and continuously improve artificial intelligence (AI) models based on purchasing patterns (self-learning).",
            "Software companies also tend to hold back on investing in other analytics tools, such as pricing and KPI dashboards. These could enable companies to establish organization-wide transparency over pricing performance, but only 38 percent of respondents say their companies have pricing dashboards to track these metrics and inform pricing decisions and broader sales strategies. The higher-growth companies in our survey sample are catching up: 44 percent of respondents at these companies say their companies are leveraging sophisticated pricing dashboards. Such tools could help software companies identify sources of lost value at the customer and product levels by tracking real-time price changes, allowing the pricing center to continuously iterate and refine its overall strategy.",
            "In our experience, companies that develop and implement a successful pricing analytics journey focus on the following actions:",
            "The most popular pricing metric at respondentsâ companies continues to be seat based (based on number of users), with roughly 40 percent of respondents indicating that their companies use this as their primary pricing metric. Seat-based metrics can certainly be the right choice for a subset of companies, especially upstarts that prioritize sales velocity. Seats are easy for customers to understand and accept, especially given that this pricing metric has long been the most prevalent.",
            "However, for many businesses, using seats as the primary metric comes with serious downside. This approach is not scalable to support future growth in revenue per customer. Also, this kind of metric is not auditable in some casesâfor example, with shared licenses or credentials. Oftentimes, seats are not directly linked to value either. Consider an analytical product that has 100 users at an enterprise company, with three power users accounting for 95 percent of the usage. Beyond the initial three licenses, the value to the company would not increase consistently as more users are added.",
            "The higher-growth software companies in our survey recognize these deficits. Fully 97 percent of respondents at these companies say they expect their pricing metric to evolve in the near term. One shift we are seeing is companies exploring usage-based metrics, driven partly by the increasingly popular pursuit of product-led growth and the potentially significant revenue growth that such a model can bring (Exhibit 2).",
            "However, usage-based pricing is not necessarily the right strategic move for every company. Depending on the product, usage may not be the sole determinant of the value the product provides to customers. Oftentimes, a productâs value comes simply from access to that product. Also, shifting to usage-based pricing requires a multi-month, cross-functional transformation. This includes preparing sales and customer success teams and upgrading back-end systems to help customers predict how much capacity they will need and be capable of refunding them when predicted estimates donât match actual usage.",
            "Given variations among companies, software executives who want to investigate changing their pricing metric may want to resist the urge to follow popular trends. Instead, they should consider what matters to customers. To set the right price metric, begin by examining where value comes from for your customers. Consider the following set of questions as a method to ",
            " for your specific software product:",
            "Customers, according to classic economic theory, tend to prefer choice. However, a proliferation of options, in the form of bundles, add-ons, and customized pricing, also has a downside. Too many options create complexity and confusion for sellers as well as buyers. For sellers, this complexity may lengthen the sales process and hamper companiesâ ability to control unnecessary discounting and its negative financial impact.",
            "Over the past three years, the average number of buying personas per software customer has increased from one to four. In addition, the average software company also offers more than seven pricing schemes (for example, perpetual, subscription, pay as you go) and ten-plus separate pricing metrics (such as per seat, usage based, or outcomes based). Many end up with highly complex pricing architecture. For instance, one software player offers more than 15 price metricsâincluding per host, per gigabyte of data ingested, per million log events, and per thousand tests runâand more than 20 different price points for those metrics. It is no wonder their customers describe their bills as complex, impossible to predict, and often much higher than expected.",
            "Companies with simpler pricing and packaging structures (such as three simple tiers for pricing and good/better/best packaging with fewer than five add-ons) are nearly 30 percent more likely to report having effective pricing and discount controls than companies with extremely complex pricing and packaging, our research shows. Simplicity also translates to greater likelihood of high growth, courtesy of faster sales velocity, less customer confusion, and ease of control and reporting on discounts (Exhibit 3).",
            "However, simplicity comes with trade-offs. Companies targeting customers in commoditized software subsectors often find that simplicity encourages price-comparison shopping and drives lower price realization.",
            "To simplify pricing and packaging, it can help to understand âvalue-adding complexity.â This means identifying areas where pricing and packaging complexity does not deliver incremental customer value and targeting only those areas for simplification, versus pursuing simplicity at all costs. Additionally, when companies have multiple discrete products that necessitate different individual metrics, it can be beneficial to wrap these disparate metrics into a single âtoken or creditâ that acts as a secondary, all-encompassing price metric to drive simplicity without sacrificing the link to value.",
            "Pricing-specific incentives can help software companies align sales efforts with the overall pricing strategy. As the case study in Exhibit 4 illustrates, this approach can encourage sales reps to negotiate the best possible pricing outcomes for the company.",
            "Despite the advantages of pricing-related sales force incentives, 53 percent of respondents to our survey report that their companies have no pricing-related sales force incentives. Once again, higher-growth companies are ahead of the curve: they are 50 percent more likely than their lower-growth peers to adopt pricing-specific sales incentives for their reps.",
            "In practice, this involves introducing upside and downside multipliers or one-time bonuses, depending on the specific business context, that are tied to pricing decisions. For instance, a B2B software company leveraged AI to give its frontline sales force discount guidance on live deals but did not activate multipliers on sales compensation tied to meeting the discount threshold. Unsurprisingly, the guidance had a negligible impact on deal outcomes.",
            "Another B2B software and services company tied its sales compensation to margin targets but not to specific pricing actions. The result was that sellers found ways to achieve margin targets by changing the product mix, rather than pulling on cost levers, to sell more higher-margin products. In contrast, a robust sales incentive strategy minimizes the potential for misaligned incentives, so the salespeople reap the benefits of pricing-related incentives in a sustainable manner.",
            "Acting now to rethink pricing strategies can help software companies propel efficient growth and stay competitive in a pricing market that is rapidly maturing. Even in less turbulent times, software leaders can push for more strategic pricing agendas by setting specific pricing targets for revenue leaders and empowering the sales force with incentives to tailor customer-specific price strategies.",
            "Furthermore, building a dedicated and mature pricing function helps software companies adapt quickly to shifting market trends and customer needs in order to capture the full value of their product and services. The following steps offer a starting point for software companies looking to get ahead.",
            "Companies can immediately elevate pricing to the top of the corporate strategic agenda by assigning a specific owner for pricing. That role should have a direct reporting line to the C-suite. To act on this priority, leaders should incorporate pricing into strategic business reviews and set specific pricing targets for revenue leaders.",
            "Over the next one to two months, companies can maximize short-term pricing realization by standing up a pricing SWAT team with the following responsibilities:",
            "Over the next six months to a year, companies can embark on a customer-backed, data-driven journey to align pricing and packaging to value. The journey would involve the following multiple steps:",
            "By building and capitalizing on new technologies, tools, and capabilities to support sophisticated pricing operations, software companies can implement new pricing models and strategies to promote efficient growth at a time when the price of inaction on this front is soaring.",

Our findings suggest that digital talent heavily values working at organizations that fully embed learning into every aspect of their culture and encourage employees to invest in their own development and advancement. By creating compelling opportunities for this group, leading organizations are not just satisfying employeesâ demands but also enabling them to be successful in ways that substantially improve individual and organization-wide performance.",

This is not about playing into the stereotype of brilliant tech talent toiling away in solitude; rather, it is about allowing top digital talent to influence and collaborate with larger numbers of colleagues without having to supervise or manage them. Ascending to the highest ranks of the expert ladder requires people skills and coaching acumen, as well as entrepreneurialism and the ability to influence people who donât report to you (including those who lack a technical background).

As a result, a new enterprise go-to-market (GTM) playbook, one that disrupts traditional enterprise sales from both the top down and the bottom up, is emerging (see sidebar âThe two major shifts in enterprise customersâ technology needsâ). ",
            "B2B tech customers are demanding expertise above all else. While organizations once looked to tech sales teams for guidance when purchasing products and solutions, they now require more robust assistance in catalyzing and guiding their digital transformations. This is a far more sophisticated role for enterprise sales teams: it requires technical acumen, detailed industry knowledge, and inteÂ­grated solutions to ensure that value is realized throughout the life cycle. Customers now prioritize expertise over elements such as having a single point of contact, and their buying decisions increasÂ­ingly involve a wide range of stakeholders instead of just IT. ",
            "At the same time, customers are demanding simplicity and self-service experiences. Customers crave the simple, highly personalized, self-service experience that has come to characterize other forms of e-commerce, from groceries to clothing to used-car sales. In fact, more than 30 percent of B2B customers are ",

            " The growth of simple-to-deploy, cloud-based solutions has paved the way for new buying models that make this experience possible. ",
            "Executing these two shifts simultaneously is a complex challenge. However, the rewards are substantial, as evidenced by the performance of several companies that have taken the lead in reimagining GTM.",
            "Our analysis of 60 top-performing software-as-a-service companies reveals that top-quartile âefficient growersâ are successfully extracting value at multiple junctures. They are effective at new-business acquisition (with more than 15 percent of growth coming from new customers), they retain and grow their install base (with net retention rates topping 125 percent), and they manage spending carefully to invest where it counts (keeping marketing and sales expenditures about or below 30 percent). ",
            "These metrics are based on the recent and unusual period of growth within the software sector. Moving forward, transforming GTM to drive retention and control costs will be even more critical.",
            "Based on our analysis of top performers, our work with tech companies, and recent interviews with dozens of executives, we believe that four critical pivots are driving sustained success in this new\nera. Companies that fail to move boldly now, and that pour more resources into traditional sales only to see customer experience decline, are likely to struggle over the next three to five years. As market conditions shift and the imperative for efficient growth gains urgency, these failures will have more significant consequences. ",
            "Even top-tier tech companies tend to focus on either transformative selling or digital, product-led growthâbut not both. In the future, it will be difficult to win in one without getting the other right. These two-part pivots are designed to weave expertise and simplicity into four functions: sales, marketing, channel, and customer success (see sidebar âThe key moves that fuel industry outperformersâ successâ). ",
            "As solutions become increasingly complex and multiÂ­year digital transformation remains critical, traditional account managers and presales specialists will find themselves insufficiently equipped to meet enterprise customersâ needs. Before investing in a new solution, enterprise customers want best practices on how to solve their needs, insights on navigating architectural trade-offs, and evidence on how the solution will deliver value. They also demand ongoing guidance and collaboration to achieve outcomes. ",
            "To better develop this new type of relationship with potential customers, high-tech leaders are embracing transformation-led sales. Large enterprise sellers also serve as account strategists, with solution and industry knowledge as well as the leadership qualities to orchestrate cross-functional teams. Specialists must be able to approach large accounts with agility, by leveraging services and independent software vendor (ISV) partners to demonstrate the art of the possible. This new approach has profound implications for talent, capabilities, and account models. One leading hyperscaler is hiring former consulting partners and industry executives to manage its largest accounts, treating those accounts almost as stand-alone businesses. ",
            "For midsize-enterprise accounts, top performers are challenging the orthodoxy of traditional enterprise sales to deliver deep expertise in a cost-efficient manner. Leaders are replacing one-to-one account managers with specialist-led hybrid models. They are blending on-site and remote work, extending specialistsâ reach to a greater number of customers. And they are equipping off-site team members\nwith the winning inside-sales playbook, so they can access the marketing tools, solution plays, and\ndata-driven insights to bring customers the right conversation at the right time. One leading software firm scaled its portfolio of 300-plus services by creating specialist-led teams aligned to either core or growth models as well as new versus expanded business. It supported this transition with tailored demand generation, aligned talent profiles, and restructured compensation. The new model is more effective and efficient than the traditional one, which has boosted productivity. ",
            "At the same time, industry leaders eager to satisfy customersâ demand for simplicity are embracing product-led growth. This involves creating simple and scalable digital self-service buying experiences\nas well as products that are easy to try, procure, deploy, and use. ",
            "Atlassianâs product-led growth model has powered double-digit annual sales increases, at a 15 percent cost of sales, for more than a decade.",
            " Atlassianâs âflywheelâ model is designed to ensure that products are âbought, not sold.â Rich content and appealing events make products easy to research, free trials and a straightÂ­forward buying process minimize the friction that buyers often associate with enterprise-grade products, and easy-to-use products result in delighted customersâwho then become engines for growth. ",
            "Even vendors of complex solutions are borrowing tactics from the product-led playbook. Snowflake and CrowdStrike use a combination of free trials, demos, simple-to-deploy solutions, and user comÂ­munities to generate demand and accelerate adoption among enterprise customers. ",
            "Historically, B2B tech has taken a relay-race approach to customer engagement: marketers build awareness to generate leads and then pass the baton to sellers. As this bifurcated process becomes impractical, marketing departments will have to broaden their roles and work jointly with sales, channel, and customer success teams to establish and support full-funnel health.",
            "In recent years, Oracle has moved away from a system prioritizing traditional marketing qualified leads, which had incentivized marketing departments to overinvest in low-value activities. Sales and marketing teams now work toward âconversation readiness,â which uses customer interaction data to evaluate intent. This generates fewer leads, but more deals are landed.",
            "Getting personalization right involves âmaking every seller a marketer.â Leaders such as Snowflake\nuse cross-functional pods and account-based marketing to support sellers with quality content that can be refined based on customer feedback. Other leaders enable sellers to send tailored emails with curated articles to those customers who have expressed interest in live calls.",
            "Personalization also needs to scale. Top marketing and sales teams are using predictive AI, campaign automation tools, and best-in-class data infrastructure to more effectively target potential customers.",

            " Among the most promising use cases is âintent analysis,â which uses âdigital breadcrumbs,â such as press releases, financial disclosures, and geolocation data, to anticipate customer needs. Some companies use customersâ job postings to predict their priorities and pinpoint their location in the buying cycle.",
            "Tech companies are âmaking every marketer a sellerâ by introducing self-serve tools and hybrid events\nto foster relationships with customers throughout their decision journeys. Examples include Google Cloudâs pricing calculator, Microsoft Azureâs total cost of ownership calculator, IBMâs hybrid cloud value calculator, and Amazon Web Servicesâ (AWS) migration evaluator.",
            "With the rise of cloud, many predicted that direct digital models would render the channel obsolete.\nIn fact, the channel is as important as ever, but thanks to a new crop of channel partners specializing in areas such as cybersecurity, cloud, and DevOps (software development and IT operations), it is evolving into a richer ecosystem valued less for its distribution scale than for its expertise in helping customers adopt new solutions and transform.",
            "Leading companies are cultivating ecosystems of fewer partners, each with a differentiated value proposition, and changing partner incentivization models to prioritize customer success. They are also leveraging alliances and ISV partnerships to build ecosystems around their platforms. Finally, a new generation of providers is introducing cloud-managed service offerings to provide simplicity\nand outcomes for customers. ",
            "These new channel players go far beyond the role of traditional value-added resellers. They add value across the life cycle, from cocreation to co-selling to codelivery and sometimes to renewal and value realization. This remains true throughout tech ecoÂ­systems, including for cloud platforms and\nproduct-led models. ",

            " CS teams add value by helping cusÂ­tomers unlock the solutionsâ full potential, which builds trust and relevance with customers. However, leading CS teams go further, identifying untapped opportunities and providing sales teams with insights into companiesâ needs. As a result, top companies are more closely aligning sales, marketing, and CS teams; bolstering CS with additional resources and technical talent; and breaking down old presales/postsales distinctions to foster collaboration across the customer life cycle. ",
            "As digital transformations increase the number and diversity of stakeholders involved in technology decisions, the urgency around CS is growing. A recent McKinsey CX survey indicates that as the number of stakeholders involved in technology purchase decisions rises, influencers are significantly less satisfied than buyers (exhibit). This gap persists across every dimension and journey stage, presenting an opportunity for vendors that engage with and bring value to a broader set of stakeholders throughout the life cycle. The survey also reflects that customers value strategic advisory as well as technical\nservices throughout the life cycle.",
            "To fund the expansion of CS, the best companies are offering subscription-based âpaid success plansâ that accelerate customer adoption and deliver high-quality experiences. These companies are developing new metrics to gauge the contributions of CS to revenue and reallocating sales resources to prioritize CS. ",
            "To fund the expansion of customer success, the best companies are offering subscription-based âpaid success plansâ that accelerate customer adoption and deliver high-quality experiences.",
            "Given the premium that B2B buyers place on seamless, simple experiences, leading tech companies are taking a holistic approach to customer experience transformation by redesigning customer journeys to eliminate pain points and create satisfying experiences. ",

            "In this new era of accelerated digital disruption, tech companies need to rebuild their GTM models\nfrom the ground up. Leading players are innovating rapidly, but the shift remains in the early stages. Because two distinct forcesâthe demand for expertise and the demand for simplicityâare shaping the future of GTM, adapting to this new world is a complex undertaking.

To complement video lectures and engage students in the virtual classroom, educators adopted technologies that enabled more interactivity and hybrid models of online and in-person activities. These tools changed learning, teaching, and assessment in ways that may persist after the pandemic. Investors have taken note. Edtech start-ups raised record amounts of venture capital in 2020 and 2021, and market valuations for bigger players soared.",

            "In November 2021, McKinsey surveyed 600 faculty members and 800 students from public and private nonprofit colleges and universities in the United States, including minority-serving institutions, about the use and impact of eight different classroom learning technologies (Exhibit 1). (For more on the learning technologies analyzed in this research, see sidebar âDescriptions of the eight learning technologies.â) To supplement the survey, we interviewed industry experts and higher-education professionals who make decisions about classroom technology use. We discovered which learning tools and approaches have seen the highest uptake, how students and educators view them, the barriers to higher adoption, how institutions have successfully adopted innovative technologies, and the notable impacts on learning (for details about our methodology, see sidebar âAbout the researchâ).",
            "Survey respondents reported a 19 percent average increase in overall use of these learning technologies since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Technologies that enable connectivity and community building, such as social mediaâinspired discussion platforms and virtual study groups, saw the biggest uptick in useâ49 percentâfollowed by group work tools, which grew by 29 percent (Exhibit 2). These technologies likely fill the void left by the lack of in-person experiences more effectively than individual-focused learning tools such as augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR). Classroom interaction technologies such as real-time chatting, polling, and breakout room discussions were the most widely used tools before the pandemic and remain so; 67 percent of survey respondents said they currently use these tools in the classroom.",
            "In November 2021, McKinsey surveyed 634 faculty members and 818 students from public, private, and minority-serving colleges and universities over a ten-day period. The survey included only students and faculty who had some remote- or online-learning experience with any of the eight featured technologies. Respondents were 63 percent female, 35 percent male, and 2 percent other gender identities;\n69 percent White, 18 percent Black or African American, 8 percent Asian, and 4 percent other ethnicities; and represented every US region.

            "Some technologies lag behind in adoption. Tools enabling student progress monitoring, AR/VR, machine learningâpowered teaching assistants (TAs), AI adaptive course delivery, and classroom exercises are currently used by less than half of survey respondents. Anecdotal evidence suggests that technologies such as AR/VR require a substantial investment in equipment and may be difficult to use at scale in classes with high enrollment. Our survey also revealed utilization disparities based on size. Small public institutions use machine learningâpowered TAs, AR/VR, and technologies for monitoring student progress at double or more the rates of medium and large public institutions, perhaps because smaller, specialized schools can make more targeted and cost-effective investments. We also found that medium and large public institutions made greater use of connectivity and community-building tools than small public institutions (57 to 59 percent compared with 45 percent, respectively). Although the uptake of AI-powered tools was slower, higher-education experts we interviewed predict their use will increase; they allow faculty to tailor courses to each studentâs progress, reduce their workload, and improve student engagement at scale (see sidebar âDifferences in adoption by type of institution observed in the researchâ).",
            "While many colleges and universities are interested in using more technologies to support student learning, the top three barriers indicated are lack of awareness, inadequate deployment capabilities, and cost (Exhibit 3).",
            "More than 60 percent of students said that all the classroom learning technologies theyâve used since COVID-19 began had improved their learning and grades (Exhibit 4). However, two technologies earned higher marks than the rest for boosting academic performance: 80 percent of students cited classroom exercises, and 71 percent cited machine learningâpowered teaching assistants.",
            "Although AR/VR is not yet widely used, 37 percent of students said they are âmost excitedâ about its potential in the classroom. While 88 percent of students believe AR/VR will make learning more entertaining, just 5 percent said they think it will improve their ability to learn or master content (Exhibit 5). Industry experts confirmed that while there is significant enthusiasm for AR/VR, its ability to improve learning outcomes is uncertain. Some data look promising. For example, in a recent pilot study,",
            " students who used a VR tool to complete coursework for an introductory biology class improved their subject mastery by an average of two letter grades.",
            "Faculty gave learning tools even higher marks than students did, for ease of use, engagement, access to course resources, and instructor connectivity. They also expressed greater excitement than students did for the future use of technologies. For example, while more than 30 percent of students expressed excitement for AR/VR and classroom interactions, more than 60 percent of faculty were excited about those, as well as machine learningâpowered teaching assistants and AI adaptive technology.",
            "Eighty-one percent or more of faculty said they feel the eight learning technology tools are a good investment of time and effort relative to the value they provide (Exhibit 6). Expert interviews suggest that employing learning technologies can be a strain on faculty members, but those we surveyed said this strain is worthwhile.",
            "While faculty surveyed were enthusiastic about new technologies, experts we interviewed stressed some underlying challenges. For example, digital-literacy gaps have been more pronounced since the pandemic because it forced the near-universal adoption of some technology solutions, deepening a divide that was unnoticed when adoption was sporadic. More tech-savvy instructors are comfortable with interaction-engagement-focused solutions, while staff who are less familiar with these tools prefer content display and delivery-focused technologies.",
            "According to experts we interviewed, learning new tools and features can bring on general fatigue. An associate vice president of e-learning at one university told us that faculty there found designing and executing a pilot study of VR for a computer science class difficult. âItâs a completely new way of instruction. . . . I imagine that the faculty using it now will not use it again in the spring.â Technical support and training help. A chief academic officer of e-learning who oversaw the introduction of virtual simulations for nursing and radiography students said that faculty holdouts were permitted to opt out but not to delay the program. âWe structured it in a âweâre doing this togetherâ way. People who didnât want to do it left, but we got a lot of support from vendors and training, which made it easy to implement simulations.â",
            "Despite the growing pains of digitizing the classroom learning experience, faculty and students believe there is a lot more they can gain. Faculty members are optimistic about the benefits, and students expect learning to stay entertaining and efficient. While adoption levels saw double-digit growth during the pandemic, many classrooms have yet to experience all the technologies. For institutions considering the investment, or those that have already started, there are several takeaways to keep in mind.",
            "In an ",
            ", we looked at the broader changes in higher education that have been prompted by the pandemic. But perhaps none has advanced as quickly as the adoption of digital learning tools. Faculty and students see substantial benefits, and adoption rates are a long way from saturation, so we can expect uptake to continue.

And the year before, well over a third of the 100 most valuable companies in the United States came from the sector, as did about a quarter of those in Asia.

            "\n",
            "âWe need to encourage more risk taking. Americans are often willing to take risks to grow fast. I think European entrepreneurs need to resist the urge to sell too quickly, often leaving a lot of the upside for the acquirers.â",

            "On a broader scale, the interviewees proposed an overarching strategic shift to help European companies succeed in the software industry. They encouraged the sector to focus on areas where Europe could leapfrog ahead by playing to its strengths, rather than trying to play catch-up in areas already dominated by others. âA strategy that entails copying the greatest US hits may, in some cases, have provided solid returns, but it is certainly not a formula for building software giants,â said one interviewee. At the same time, on a more practical level, the interviewees noted the importance of embracing state-of-the-art operating practices to help new companies scale rapidly and overcome the inherent disadvantages of a fragmented market (See sidebar, âEuropean software executive perspectives,â for more views). ",
            "Our interviews and research point to three areas where Europe could take a lead and build large players by playing to the continentâs strengths: vertical",
            " software, software platforms for digitizing small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), and horizontal platforms built on European R&D excellence.",
            "The annual global market for vertical software, which powers industry-specific processes, currently stands at around $100 billion and is expected to grow at an annual rate of some 19 percent over the next five years. That level of growth not only exceeds that of more general functional or horizontal software but would be strong enough to support existing software companies as well as a number of new, global champions.",
            "   ",
            "Many of the largest B2B software companies have already made moves to establish themselves in the space. Salesforce has acquired Vlocity, a start-up with industry-specific solutions; Oracle has made multiple acquisitions of software companies that serve  industries such as construction, communications, retail, and hospitality and travel; and SAP, Europeâs largest software company, has launched an industry cloud to provide solutions for many verticals. Notwithstanding, the field still remains relatively open, and Europe has grounds on which to build leadership. ",
            "It is important to note that Europe already has a strong position in a number of industry verticals such as automotive, construction, pharmaceuticals, and travel, giving would-be European software giants valuable access to target customers in order to understand their businesses and emerging needs and develop close working relationships. ",
            "Software companies could then choose to build and scale their own solutions or consolidate assets with other software companies to build scale. They could even join forces with companies in the target industries to create new solutions. And large industrial companies could leverage their own software assets by treating them as truly separate businesses. On these last two points, Europe has a strong track record with two of the three most valuable software companies in the continent (Dassault SystÃ¨mes and Amadeus) emerging from the initiative of the vertical industries involved. ",
            "Amadeus, a global airline reservations system, was formed in 1987 in a collaboration between Air France, Iberia, Lufthansa, and SAS. It has since grown to become a world leader in this segment, expanding to provide software for airlines, hotels, and airports and establishing itself as one of Europeâs largest and most valuable software companies. ",
            "Dassault SystÃ¨mes has carried off a similar feat in aerospace and heavy engineering. It was created in 1981 when Dassault Aviation spun off its software division in a strategic partnership with IBM, aiming to commercialize its computer-aided aircraft design software. Today, the company is the second most valuable software company in Europe and is recognized as a global leader in software for 3-D product design, simulation, manufacturing, and more. Recently, it expanded into pharmaceuticals, providing software for drug development and the development of COVID-19 vaccines.",
            "SMEsâsmall to medium-size enterprises with fewer than 250 employeesâdominate the European Unionâs economy, accounting for more than 50 percent of GDP and 65 percent of employment. In the United States, the figures are around ten to 15 percentage points lower.",
            " Despite that prominence, European SMEs have been slow to digitize, and large B2B software companies tend to not serve the sector, regarding it as a niche market in which local companies can compete more effectively. Nevertheless, European SMEs have been significant spenders in technology, with companies with\nfewer than 1,000 employees spending more than $30 billion a year on software alone (nearly\nhalf of which is spent on vertical- or industry-specific software).",
            "That demand is likely to grow as the COVID-19 crisis has prompted SMEs, like larger organizations, to recognize the importance of digitization if they are to buy, sell, and collaborate remotely. Aspiring software champions have the opportunity to meet that demand and grow it further by building large SME platforms that span Europe and beyond and offer newer, more advanced solutions such as predictive AI or Internet of Things (IoT).",
            "The largest software companies currently exploring this seemingly fertile ground are not EuropeanâIntuit being an example. And even Stripe, a software-enabled payments company now dual headquartered in the United States and Ireland, was started by its Irish founders in California. Notwithstanding, a crop of new European companies are emerging in areas from financial management to process automation. Amsterdam-based fintech unicorn Mollie, a payments services provider, is one such player.",
            "European private investment in R&D lags well behind that in other regionsâ1.4 percent of GDP compared with 2.2 percent in the United States and 1.7 percent in China.",
            " Some interviewees noted that this was consistent with what they see as the short-term focus and moderate growth ambitions of European companies and investors. Others felt that European companies lacked confidence in their ability to innovate.",
            "In contrast, Europe performs well when it comes to R&D in the public and educational sectors, spending 0.7 percent of GDP compared with 0.5 percent spending in China and 0.8 percent in the United States.",
            " This is reflected in its academic record: Europe is home to 16 of the top 50 global life-science universities and is recognized as a world leader in some spheres, such as cell and gene therapy (CGT) research. Between 2017 and 2019, it published some ",
            "Â whose lead authors were affiliated with a European institution. Equivalent figures for US and Chinese papers were 72,000 and 100,000, respectively.",
            "The interviewees felt that investors and companies could work more closely with European research universities and institutions to translate this kind of basic research into economic value and market leadership. In doing so, they could emulate the model used in technology hubs in Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, or North Carolinaâs Research Triangle, where local companies cofund many projects with top educational institutions, and investors are quick to identify new ideas and talent from those institutions to help create new companies and innovative products and services.",
            "Similar hubs are being built in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, and Paris, and there is a âgolden triangleâ in England with strong ties to top-tier UK universities based in Cambridge, London, and Oxford. This hub kick-started the lionâs share of the United Kingdomâs approximately 100 unicorns and attracted venture capital worth $15 billion in 2020.",
            " Notwithstanding, our interviewees believe that Europeâs academic strength is not being used to its full advantage. They felt that government promotion of hubs could help, but companies and investors are ultimately those that must forge the links. ",
            "European companies can also help shape the agendas of academic and research institutions, as these are not always aligned with future economic priorities. For example, as of October 2021, Europeâs share of patents granted in three high-potential technology areasâedge computing, computer vision, and blockchainâstood between 9 and 11 percent. The US share was 72 to 88 percent and Asiaâs 8 to 19 percent.",
            "European companies seeking to become big players would need to think about how to adopt the software industryâs operational and management best practices in order to overcome the challenge of a fragmented European market. They will also likely need to build scaleâfast. Two practices stand out.",
            "Chinese and US software companies can build scale quickly given their huge home markets. In Europe, analysis shows that it takes companies time to expand across multiple smaller marketsâtime software companies do not have if they want to compete for global leadership. One interviewee went as far as to suggest that some companiesâthose with novel, deeply technical applications that do not depend on local knowledge, for exampleâmight even eschew the European market and expand in the United States first. âCountry-by-country expansion within Europe is too time-consuming, giving US and Chinese competitors the chance to catch up and occupy those markets,â one CEO told us. A United Statesâfirst approach is one that many Israeli and Indian technology companies have used successfully. ",
            "Companies that focus on Europe initially could consider remote-sales-hub models to speed expansion, rather than rely exclusively on country subsidiaries. Often adopted by US companies entering Europe, the model entails creating pan-European, âinside sales centersâ in locations where many prospective employees are multilingualâBarcelona, Dublin, and Tel Aviv, for exampleâand can drive sales remotely. Our analysis suggests that such a sales model can be 25 percent more productive than a field-sales-only model if used with the right set of accounts and with effective operational practices and tools. In fact, operational excellence is such a critical differentiator that the sales ROI of the top quartile of inside-sales organizations are more than double that of the bottom quartile. ",
            " Interviewees pointed out that European companies are often slow to adopt the latest development tools and architectures. âThe larger ones in particular are often less likely to move fast on new-technology adoption,â said one interviewee. This, in turn, impacts growth. On average, top-quartile software organizations grow roughly four to five times as fast as bottom-quartile performers with respect to developer velocity, ",
            ", and these fast growers are largely based in the United States. Growth (or lack of it) then feeds into valuations: only three of the ten most valuable companies in Europe enjoy an enterprise-value-to-revenue multiple comparable to or higher than the median US software-as-a-service (SaaS) company.",
            "Several interviewees emphasized there was a perceived shortage of product managers. âEurope has great talent, but loses more than it attracts,â said one, partly due to greater financial rewards elsewhere. âThe critical combination of technical skills coupled with strong business judgment and an entrepreneurial mindset is hard to find in Europe,â said another. Interviewees wanted to see governments help build and attract the talent needed by, for example, promoting programs to help international software talent live and work in Europe or global or regional university rotation programs to expose promising European talent to more ambitious environments. But to win at a global scale, software companies would likely have to establish a high-quality, end-to-end operating model for product management, central to which will be talent management. ",
            "Israel perhaps serves as the strongest proof that smaller countries can thrive in the global tech economy. Its well-studied start-up ecosystem has produced outsize successes, with companies such as Amdocs, Check Point, and NICE now global software players, and the likes of monday.com and SentinelOne having had successful IPOs in the United States.",
            "While the public sector can help European companies make a similar leap, entrepreneurs, investors, and private-sector companies have an important and urgent role to play too. They  cannot wait for conditions to change before taking action. To prevent software gnawing away at the competitiveness of many of its industries and its economy, Europe must aspire to generate global software and software-enabled companies within the next decade by taking a new, bold approach that builds on its strengths rather than trying to make up for its weaknesses.",

            " In terms of wealth inequality, the top 1 percent hold nearly 40 percent of the nationâs net worth as of 2019, the highest on record since the Federal Reserve began collecting survey data in 1989.",
            "This inequality has disproportionately affected communities of color, women, those less physically abled, and certain geographies. For example, between January 1972 and December 2019, other than during the aftermath of recessions, the unemployment rate for Black workers has stayed at or above twice the rate for white workers.",
            " On the wealth front, the racial wealth gap between Black and white households grew from $100,000 in 1992 to $164,100 in 2019.",
            " The impact of shrinking such inequities would be huge: eliminating disparities in wealth between Black and white households and Hispanic and white households could result in the addition of $2 trillion to $3 trillion of incremental annual GDP to the US economy.",

            " is one of the most important priorities of our time. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, and despite the longest economic expansion in US history through much of the 2010s, the United States has been experiencing record levels of economic inequality. As our country continues to deal with a pandemic that has disproportionately affected the lives and livelihoods of women, people of color, low-income workers, and other vulnerable groups, the need for a more inclusive growing economy could not be more pressing. Contrary to fears that economic inclusion must come at the expense of economic growth, our research supports the idea that economic growth is at its best when it is most inclusive. Conversely, left unaddressed, inequality and economic exclusion threaten economic growth. By embedding equity into the development process and improving opportunities for those on the margins to meaningfully participate in the mainstream economy, we can push forward a more sustainable and equitable economy. Together, public-, private-, and social-sector leaders can work with communities to bring about the transformative change that creates an economy that works better and benefits everyone.",

            "At the same time, as of the end of 2020, more than 70 million Americansâapproximately 40 percent of US workersâhad applied for unemployment benefits since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            " And the US economy contracted by 3.5 percent on an annual basis in 2020 alone and may take several years to recover.",
            " Indeed, COVID-19 is accelerating trends that existed before the pandemic, and without a more inclusive recovery, existing disparities may further calcify.",
            "These realities demand that leaders work to both stimulate the US economy and make it more inclusive, ensuring that the COVID-19 pandemic does not considerably increase material deprivation, lead to financial ruin or downward mobility, or result in permanent, detrimental changes to our economic structure. We believe that to achieve long-term, sustainable, and inclusive growth, public-, private-, and social-sector leaders must work together to embed equity in the development process.",
            "The perceived tension between inclusion and growthâand the false belief that they should be addressed separatelyâhas hampered efforts to pursue and achieve inclusive growth. But in fact, insufficient economic inclusion is a threat to prosperity, and it is difficult to improve economic mobility and resource distribution without increasing the overall size of the economy (Exhibit 1).",
            "Research suggests that up to 40 percent of GDP growth in the US economy between 1960 and 2010 can be attributed to greater participation of women and people of color in the labor force through improved\ntalent allocation.",

Practitioners engaged in this work say they seek to achieve outcomes that benefit all segments of society while also supporting those on the margins and reducing relative inequality.",
            "Additionally, research shows that todayâs inequalities may be self-perpetuating: as living standards and social mobility stagnate, many populations fall into a vicious cycle of underdevelopment that threatens long-term growth for everyone. Families and communities arenât able to make investments in their children and their physical and social environments, creating barriers to human and place-based development that thwart access to opportunities. In turn, this limits the ability of these groups to participate in growth processes, and, worse, their environments are left without the ingredients to build momentum and reverse these dynamics.",
            "In working closely with state and local governments, private-sector and civic leaders, and communities across the country, weâve developed a three-phased approach practitioners can take to realize a more inclusive economy (Exhibit 2). This approach is informed by an understanding that any successful effort will need to bring together technical expertise, adaptive approaches and mindsets, and community engagement to alter adverse dynamics in complex environments.

            "It is equally important for leaders to understand the starting point and measure the potential opportunity of addressing key outcomes. Robust fact gathering that highlights not just current-day realities but also\nthe rich historical context of communities can help stakeholders fully appreciate the depth and complexities of the challenges they face.",
            "Finally, aligning public-, private-, and social-sector leaders on a bold, measurable aspiration that is anchored in facts and the assets of the community provides a North Star by which to navigate measurable goals, interventions, and investments.",
            "The first step in designing comprehensive interventions is to identify barriers to and opportunities for impact. Practitioners should consider conducting assessments to identify the root causes impeding\nkey journeys and forces leading to inequality. Understanding these forces will allow practitioners to assess the trade-offs of different interventions and also design targeted interventions that will generate more equitable outcomes.",
            "For example, there is a clear homeownership gap in the United States across demographic groups. Compared with white Americans, Black Americans have 30 percent lower homeownership rates, Hispanic Americans have 26 percent lower rates, and Asian Americans have 16 percent lower rates. Numerous barriers contribute to these discrepancies, including economic, market, sociocultural, and institutional factors. Whereas traditional interventions address a single barrier at a time, true change will require coordinated action from public-, private-, and social-sector stakeholders to comprehensively address bottlenecks across all barriers.",
            "Public-, private-, and social-sector leaders should consider implementing critical infrastructure to help sustain progress and achieve inclusive economic outcomes over time. For example, they can invest in monitoring and evaluation systems that collect feedback, launch pilot initiatives to help establish proofs of concept, and establish ways of meaningfully engaging internal and external stakeholders\nto inform actions and refinements. Also, it is important for leaders to continually and transparently communicate progress with communities and change course as needed.",
            "It will take strong shifts in resources and capabilities, stakeholder interests and organizational incentives, and trust across social networks to sustain execution that ensures inclusion occurs alongside growth in the development process. By working together, public-, private-, and social-sector leaders can achieve this to help various demographic groups overcome the barriers that have kept them from fully participating in and contributing to an economy that benefits everyone.",
