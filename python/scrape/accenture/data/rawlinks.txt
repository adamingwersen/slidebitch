Zero-based Technology (ZBT) is a value-based alternative to traditional IT cost reduction that rotates the IT cost base, freeing funds to invest in technology-enabled business transformation. ZBT applies a zero-base to all IT spend, creating efficiencies and optimizing core IT spend by identifying cost levers and modeling savings and investment scenarios, generating cash for reinvestment in capabilities that drive growth. Companies can use ZBT to get new visibility and control of IT costs, creating a variable cost structure and focusing spending on the right investment for a technology-powered business transformation.","description":null,"featuredimage":null,"featuredvideo":null,"featuredmediatype":null,"linkingtoparent":null,"branchtemplate":null,"relatedLinkData":{"analytics-link-name":"COVID-19: Zero-Based Technology (ZBT) For Growth","xdm:linkURL":"https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/strategy/coronavirus-zero-based-technology","analytics-engagement":"false","analytics-link-type":"serp-ranked"},"_id":null,"_name":null,"_language":null,"all_contenttype":[{"name":"Insights"}],"all_contentdate":{"dateformat":null,"docdate":1597190400000,"ishidden":false}},{"title":null,"sitecoreitemid":"1632062002","seotitle":"COVID-19: Repurposing Your Supply Chain","relativepath":"https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/consulting/coronavirus-supply-chain-rapid-response","articledescription":null,"seodescription":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted supply chains, and businesses must respond rapidly to improve supply chain resilience.
