The RIL can offer more strategic data and analytics outcomes much faster than a typical top-down transformation, while also promoting data literacy and data-driven decision making across the organisation.",

Hidden workers can help companies close a skills gap: Those hiring hidden workers were 36% less likely to face talent and skills shortages. The research identified several categories of people who became hidden workers, including people who have health issues, gaps in employment histories, family care responsibilities, few formal qualifications, required relocation, and disadvantaged backgrounds.",
